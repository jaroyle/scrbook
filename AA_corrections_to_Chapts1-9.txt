Chapter 4/5:
Rahel had this comment which I forgot about:
reading Ch4 Closed I found a paragraph that's very similar to Ch5 - SCR0, so maybe we should remove it from Ch5. It's under Simulating SCR Data, where you explain why we use nind, ntraps etc in code (instead of n, J...). In Ch4 the same stuff comes up in section Model M0 in BUGS. Maybe take a look at both of them simultaneously and see what you think.
Andy needs to fix this when we have copy-edits back.
