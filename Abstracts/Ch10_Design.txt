Sampling Design

In the context of spatial sampling problems, where populations of
mobile animals are sampled by an array of traps or devices, there are
a number of critical design elements. Two of the most important ones
are the spacing and configuration of traps (or sampling devices)
within the array.  For traditional capture-recapture, conceptual and
heuristic design considerations have been addressed by a number of
authors, but little formal analysis focused on spatial design of
arrays has been carried out. In this chapter we recommend a general
framework for evaluating design choices for SCR studies using Monte
Carlo simulation of specific design scenarios based on trade-offs
between available effort, funding, logistics and other practical
considerations -- what we call scenario analysis. 
While we recommend
scenario analysis as a general tool to understand your expected data
before carrying out a spatial capture-recapture study, it is possible
to develop some heuristics and even analytic results related to the
broader problem of model-based spatial design using an explicit
objective function based on the inference objective.  We outline an
approach where we identify a variance criterion,
namely, the variance of an estimator of N for the prescribed
state-space. We show that this depends on the configuration of trap
locations, and we provide a framework for optimizing the variance
criterion over the design space (the collection of all possible
designs of a given size).
