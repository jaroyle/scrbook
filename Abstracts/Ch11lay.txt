Modeling spatial variation in density

All SCR models considered so far assumed that animals are distributed
uniformly in space, but ecological processes such as habitat selection
can result in non-uniform distributions of
organisms. In this chapter we present a method for fitting spatial
capture-recapture models that allow the locations of activity
centers to be a function of spatially-referenced covariates, thus
allowing for variation of density across the state space. These models
are referred to as "inhomogeneous point process" (or IPP) models.  To
analyze SCR data using an IPP model in continuous space we provide a
custom MCMC algorithm in the accompanying R package scrbook. Discrete
space IPP models can be implemented in the BUGS language, or in the R
package secr. Moreover, we can combine IPP models with models using
ecological distance (i.e., distance as perceived by the organism under
study, which for example might be related to habitat structure) instead of Eucledian distance (see Chapt. 12). This makes it possible to simultaneously
estimate parameters describing the effect of habitat on density
and on animal movement from simple SCR data.  We apply the IPP model
to a camera trap data set of jaguars from Argentina, using the degree
of protection from poaching as a density covariate.
