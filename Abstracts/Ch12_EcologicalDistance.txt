Ecological Distance

As a practical matter, SCR models based on Euclidean distance imply
circular, symmetric, and stationary home ranges of individuals, and
these are not often biologically realistic.  In this chapter we
present an alternative to using Euclidean distance to measure the
distance from traps to individual activity centers.  After discussing
the shortcomings of Euclidean distance models, we present an
alternative approach based on a cost-weighted distance metric, and the
least-cost path between an individual's activity center and a trap
location.  Examples of how to calculate cost-weighted distances are
provided as well as how to simulate SCR data and fit models based on
``ecological distance".  We also provide a likelihood analysis based
on the ecological distance models.  Being able to conduct such
analyses requires knowledge of how to do basic geographic analysis in
R, which we show specifically how to do.  This functionality is also
useful for calculating distances in an irregular patch, such as would
be applicable to corridor and reserve design analyses.  Parameterizing
SCR models in terms of one or more parameters that relate the {\it
resistance} of the landscape to explicit covariates allows us to
explicitly accommodate landscape structure and account for
connectivity of the landscape.
