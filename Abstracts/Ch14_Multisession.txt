Stratified Populations: Multi-session and multi-site data

In this chapter, we describe SCR models for situations when we have
multiple distinct sample groups, strata or "sessions" (the term used
in secr), and our interest is in modeling variation in population size
or density among the different strata.
 Such stratified populations are commonplace in capture-recaptures
 studies, especially in the context where the strata represent
 distinct spatial regions.
A standard example that arises frequently is that in which multiple
habitat patches (often refuges, parks or reserves) are sampled
independently with the goal of estimating the population size of some
focal species in each reserve. 

We present a Bayesian framework for inference for stratified SCR
models using data augmentation, and also  demonstrate the use of
multi-session models in the R package secr. 
We apply the stratified models to the ovenbird data, in which the
strata are not spatially indexed but, instead, represent temporally
defined strata (years). For such cases, we imagine a fully dynamic, or
demographically open model might be appropriate -- one that involves
survival and recruitment (covered in Chapt. 16). However, the
stratified SCR models can be thought of as a primitive type of model
for open systems in which the population sizes are assumed to be
independent, and so we might still find them useful as simplified
models for open populations.
