In this chapter, we discuss spatial capture-recapture models in the
context of populations that are open to demographic processes such as mortality and birth, and
movement dynamics such as dispersal or migration.  First, we provide an
introduction to the ordinary (non-spatial) Jolly-Seber (JS) model, which estimates both abundance and demographic rates.
We address how to carry out Bayesian analysis of this model using a data augmentation
framework, as well as a few of the technical issues related to this formulation
of the model. Using data
augmentation, it is easy to provide an individual capture-history
formulation of the model, and this facilitates the inclusion of
individual covariates. Based on this individual capture-history formulation of the model, it is straight forward to extend the non-spatial to a spatial JS model. 

 We reanalyze the
ovenbird mist-netting data from Efford et al. (2004), which we
previously analyzed using the multi-session modeling framework, using a spatial Jolly-Seber type of model.  We further discuss the
classical Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model, which is a
restricted version of the JS model that conditions on entry into the
sample, and therefore does not model the recruitment
process.  We provide an example of modeling movement and survival
using a spatial CJS model fitted to data from a study of American shad
in spawning migration.  Finally, we discuss other
types of spatial capture-recapture models that involve more complex
movement dynamics such as dispersal, encorporating, for example, a model
for how individual activity centers move throughout time.
