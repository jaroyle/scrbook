and temporal population dynamics, including
survival, recruitment, and
movement, migration and dispersal.
We being with an introduction to the ordinary (non-spatial)
"Jolly-Seber model" for which we address Bayesian analysis using the
data augmentation framework which we have used throughout the book. 
Using data augmentation, it is easy to provide an individual
capture-history formulation of the model, and this faciliates the
inclusion of individual covariates. As SCR models are a type of
individual covariate model, we find that spatial JS models pose no
conceptual or technical challenge.
We discuss the classical 
 Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model as well, which is a restricted
 version of the JS model that conditions on entry into the sample, and
 therefore the model does not model the recruitment process. 

We reanalyze the ovenbird mist-netting data from Efford XXXXX

We analyze data using the spatial CJS model for American shad
in spawning migration, 

We discuss other types of dynamic models for activity centers that
accommodate movement.........
