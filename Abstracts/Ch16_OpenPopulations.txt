context of populations that are open to demographic processes, and
movement dynamics such as dispersal or migration.  We being with an
introduction to the ordinary (non-spatial) "Jolly-Seber model".
We address how to carry out Bayesian analysis using data augmentation
framework and a few of the technical issues related to this formulation
of the model. Using data
augmentation, it is easy to provide an individual capture-history
formulation of the model, and this facilitates the inclusion of
individual covariates.  As SCR models are a type of individual
covariate model, we find that spatially explicit Jolly-Seber models
pose no conceptual or technical challenges beyond that induced by
closed models and the use of data augmentation.  We reanalyze the
ovenbird mist-netting data from Efford et al. (2004) which we
previously analyzed using the multi-session modeling framework but
here we use a spatial Jolly-Seber type of model.  We discuss the
classical Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model as well, which is a
restricted version of the JS model that conditions on entry into the
sample, and therefore the recruitment
process is not modeled.  We provide an example of modeling movement and survival
using a spatial CJS model fitted to data from a study of American shad
in spawning migration.  Finally, we discuss (without examples) other
types of spatial capture-recapture models that involve more complex
movement dynamics such as dispersal, which may involve a dynamic model
for individual activity centers.
