Unmarked Populations 


All SCR models described in previous chapters address the classical  situation
(of all capture-recapture) in which individuals in the population can be
uniquely identified when captured. 
This is not always possible using common methods of sampling. 
In this chapter, we investigate spatially explicit alternatives for estimating density
of unmarked populations. That is, when individual 
identity is not possible or not available.
We develop a framework for inference in these cases by specifying a
model for observed trap-specific counts that is conditional on an
underlying SCR model. 
The encounter histories are completely latent and
the observed counts are aggregations of the latent encounter
histories.
 Because the model is formulated in terms of the
data we wish we had, i.e. the typical encounter history data observed
in standard capture-recapture studies of marked animals, the model for
counts 
is just a SCR model with a single extension to account for the fact
that the encounter history data are unobserved. 
Using the methods in this chapter, we find that SCR models can
be applied to data collected using methods like points counts in which
observers record simple counts of animals at an array of survey
locations. The model can also be fitted to camera trapping data collected on
unmarked animals, representing one of the first formal method for estimating
density from such data.
We focus 
on situations in which all individuals are unmarked, and
we begin by presenting the most basic formulation of the model where
we give an example ionvolving simulated data. Then we proceed, by
way of a few examples, to consider extensions of the model in which
ancillary information can be used to increase precision.
We provide an application to a standard bird point counting problem. 
Extensions of the method to improve precision include obtaining
informative priors based on information from the literature, or using
a subsample of marked inedividuals (covered in detail in Chapt. 19). 
We give an example
