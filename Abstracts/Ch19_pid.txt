all individuals are identifiable upon encounter because they carry
some form of individual mark. In Chapt. 19 we introduced and developed
an SCR model for non-identifiable individuals.  These two extremes are
common in the study of animal populations with non-invasive sampling
methods. However, there is also an intermediate situation where part
of the population is tagged or otherwise marked and can thus be
identified upon recapture, while the unmarked portion remains
unidentifiable.  In this situation so-called mark-resight models can
be used to estimate population size and density by combining data from
both the marked and unmarked individuals.
Mark-resight studies a sample of individuals
is captured and tagged (or otherwise marked) during a single marking
event. Marking is followed by resighting surveys, upon which both the
detection of marked and unmarked animals is recorded. Resighting
surveys are usually non-invasive (hence the name `resighting'), so
that they don't involve handling of animals. 

An essential assumption of
mark-resight models is that the marked individuals are a
representative sample of the study population, so that inference about
detection can be made for the whole population from the marked
sample. While this is also an implicit assumption of capture-recapture
models, in mark-resight models this means that the process of marking
individuals requires careful consideration in order to produce a
random sample.  This assumption is usually addressed by employing a
different method for marking than for resighting.

In this chapter we consider mark-resight within a spatial context and
develop a spatial mark-resight (SMR) model. 

In the following sections we first provide some background information
on mark-resight and the types of data such surveys can provide. We
will further explore the implications of the assumption of the marked
individuals being a random subset of the population, which, in the
context of SMR models refers to not only the \emph{demographic
composition}, but also to the \emph{spatial distribution} of the
marked individuals in the state-space ${\cal S}$.  In many real life
sampling situations, this assumption will not hold -- animals will
most often be marked in some region that does not represent the entire
state-space. As a result, the distribution of marked individuals will
generally \emph{not} follow a homogeneous point process, but their
activity centers will be concentrated in the vicinity of where marking
took place.  For the sake of model development, however, throughout
the central part of this chapter we will make the assumption that
marked animals are a random sample from the population in ${\cal
S}$. We will show that SMR models are hybrids of standard SCR models
and the models presented in Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked} for data
where individuals cannot be uniquely identified. We explore models for
both known and unknown numbers of marked individuals, and for
imperfect individual identification of marks, and approaches to
incorporate telemetry location data. In the spatial framework, most of
the information on model parameters comes from the marked
individuals. But in Sec. \ref{partialID.sec.info} we will see that,
analogous to the models we developed previously in
Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}, the spatial correlation in counts of
unmarked individuals also contributes information about detection and
movement.  We conclude the chapter by presenting some general
strategies for addressing a situation where marked individuals are not
a random sample from ${\cal S}$.

















 types of resighting: (1) known number of marked guys
  (2) unknown number of marked guys....

 (3) unknown mark status. .....  some of the resightings we identify as
 marked but some we don't bother to, so we dont know if they're marked or not


we give an example of (2) using canada geese from NC. 

We show a simulation  study to assess how much information  marked vs unmarked
guys contribute

We say a bit about using telemetry data....


We give an example using raccoons on the outer banks of NC.


We have a whole section on the importance of the random sample. Mostly
we expect this is not true, and the effect of this , and development
of extensions, needs to be the focus of future work.
