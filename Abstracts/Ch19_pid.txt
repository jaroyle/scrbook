Spatial mark-resight models


Throughout most of this book we have dealt with the situation where
all individuals are identifiable upon encounter because they carry
some form of individual mark. In Chapt. 19 we introduced and developed
an SCR model for non-identifiable individuals.  These two extremes are
common in the study of animal populations with non-invasive sampling
methods. However, there is also an intermediate situation where part
of the population is tagged or otherwise marked, while some
individuals are unidentifiable.  In this situation so-called
mark-resight models can be used to estimate population size and
density by combining data from both the marked and unmarked
individuals.  In mark-resight studies a sample of individuals is
captured and marked during a single marking event. Marking is followed
by resighting surveys, upon which both the detection of marked and
unmarked animals is recorded.

In this chapter we consider mark-resight within a spatial context and
develop a spatial mark-resight (SMR) model. 
We first provide some background information
on mark-resight and the types of data such surveys can provide. 
The main distinctions hinge on whether or not we know the number of
marked individuals, and whether we can correctly determine whether an
individuals are marked or not.

An essential assumption of
mark-resight models is that the marked individuals are a
representative sample of the study population.
 While this is also an implicit assumption of capture-recapture
models, in mark-resight models this means that the process of marking
individuals requires careful consideration in order to produce a
random sample.  This assumption is usually addressed by employing a
different method for marking than for resighting.


We
will further explore the implications of the assumption of the marked
individuals being a random subset of the population, which, in the
context of SMR models refers to not only the \emph{demographic
composition}, but also to the \emph{spatial distribution} of the
marked individuals in the state-space ${\cal S}$.  In many real life
sampling situations, this assumption will not hold.
 For the sake of model development, however, throughout
the central part of this chapter we will make the assumption that
marked animals are a random sample from the population in ${\cal
S}$. 

We explore models for
both known and unknown numbers of marked individuals, and for
imperfect individual identification of marks, and approaches to
incorporate telemetry location data. 

We present 2 applications:
(a) we apply the models with  unknown number of marked guys to a study of
canada geese from north carolina. 
(b) We give an example involving radio telemetry applied to
a study of racoons on the outer banks of NC.

We conclude the chapter by presenting some general
strategies for addressing a situation where marked individuals are not
a random sample from the state-space. 
Mostly 
we expect this is not true, and the effect of this , and development
of extensions, needs to be the focus of future work.
