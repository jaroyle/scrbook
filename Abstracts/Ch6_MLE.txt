Likelihood analysis of spatial capture-recapture models

In this chapter we show how to compute maximum likelihood estimates of
SCR model parameters both directly in R and using the R package secr
(Efford, 2011). We walk through a simulation example in which the number
of animals, N, is known in order to provide a clear development of
concepts and implementation, and show that this approach is readily
extended to the more general case where N is unknown. Using a discrete
state space gives us the flexibility to clip out areas of non-habitat
(for example, bodies of water) and carry out our likelihood analysis
only across habitat deemed suitable to the species. Likelihood
functions for all these scenarios are provided in the accompanying R
package scrbook and we apply these models to a wolverine camera
trapping data set.  Alternatively, we can use the R package secr,
which provides a range of functionality for preparing data, fitting
different models (e.g. with behavioral, time of site-specific effects)
and summarizing and visualizing the results. We guide the reader
through all steps associated with an analysis in secr and re-analyze
the wolverine data set.  While the Bayesian implementation of SCR
models in the BUGS language gives us the flexibility to fit models we
cannot readily fit in secr, for certain models a likelihood-based
analysis is straightforward and can be more practical and
efficient. We cover some of these cases in later chapters of the book.
