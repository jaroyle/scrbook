Chapter 7: Modeling variation in encounter probability


Abstract

 In this chapter, we discuss general models for how encounter
probability decreases as a function of distance, and how to formulate
the encounter probability model to depend on different kinds of
covariates, which may vary by individual, by trap, or over time.
Individual covariates may be fixed, partially or completely
unobserved.  Date: Sex:

 We will see that models containing these different types of
 covariates are relatively easy to describe in WinBUGS or JAGS, and
 therefore to analyze using Bayesian analysis of the joint likelihood
 based on data augmentation thus providing a coherent and flexible
 framework for inference for all classes of SCR models.

Throughout the chapter, we will
 continue to develop the analysis of the black bear study introduced in Chapt. 4, using the
 software JAGS.

We also consider the likelihood analysis of many of these models; to
 do so, we continue to use the R package secr , and we introduce some
 ideas of model comparison using AIC (Sec. 7.4 at the end of the
 chapter). There are other types of covariates that we do not cover in
 this chapter; for example, covariates that vary across the landscape
 might affect density, and we consider these covariates in
 Chapt. 11. Alternatively, these landscape covariates might affect the
 way individuals use space. There are probably very few circumstances
 under which animals use all space uniformly and we develop more
 realistic models of encounter probability in which covariates affect
 space usage in Chapt.
