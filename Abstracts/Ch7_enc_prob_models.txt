Chapter 7: Modeling variation in encounter probability

In this chapter, we discuss a number of parametric models for
describing how the encounter probability decreases as a function of
distance.  Most models, such as the Gaussian kernel that we have used in
a number of examples, include a parameter that acts as a baseline
encounter probability, and a scale parameter determining how
rapidly encounter probability declines with distance. We present
models for encounter probability that depend on different kinds of
covariates, which may vary by individual, by trap, or over
time. Both the baseline encounter probability and the scale parameter
can be modeled as functions of these covariates. Covariates may be
fully observed (e.g., trap specific covariates), partially observed
(e.g., sex), or unobserved (e.g., individual heterogeniety).  
Each of these types of covariates can be easily modeled
in WinBUGS or JAGS, and for demonstration, we continue with the
analysis of the black bear data introduced in Chapt. 4. We also
consider the likelihood analysis of many of these
models using the R package secr, which gives us the opportunity
introduce model comparison using AIC. More details on model selection
and model evaluation are presented in Chapt. 8.
