Chapter 7: Modeling variation in encounter probability


 In this chapter, we discuss a number of parametric models for how
 encounter probability decreases as a function of distance.  Most
 models include a parameter that acts as a baseline encounter
 probability , and a shape or scale parameter of the parametric
 function. We develop models for encounter probability that depend on
 different kinds of covariates, which may vary by individual, by trap,
 or over time. Individual covariates may be fixed (e.g., trap specific
 covariates), partially observed (e.g., sex) or completely unobserved
 (latent).  Covariates of all sorts may be modeled on the baseline
 encounter probability, or on the scale parameter of the encounter
 probabilty model. We will see that models containing these different
 types of covariates are relatively easy to describe in WinBUGS or
 JAGS.  Throughout the chapter, we will continue to develop the
 analysis of the black bear study introduced in Chapt. 4, using
 JAGS. We also consider the likelihood analysis of many of these
 models; to do so, we continue to use the R package secr , and we
 introduce some ideas of model comparison using AIC (Sec. 7.4 at the
 end of the chapter).
