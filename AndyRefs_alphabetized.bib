  abstract = {Studies of the distribution of elusive forest wildlife have suffered
	from the confounding of true presence with the uncertainty of detection.
	Occupancy modeling, which incorporates probabilities of species detection
	conditional on presence, is an emerging approach for reducing observation
	bias. However, the current likelihood modeling framework is restrictive
	for handling unexplained sources of variation in the response that
	may occur when there are dependence structures such as smaller sampling
	units that are nested within larger sampling units. We used multilevel
	Bayesian occupancy modeling to handle dependence structures and to
	partition sources of variation in occupancy of sites by terrestrial
	salamanders (family Plethodontidae) within and surrounding an earlier
	wildfire in western Oregon, USA. Comparison of model fit favored
	a spatial N-mixture model that accounted for variation in salamander
	abundance over models that were based on binary detection/non-detection
	data. Though catch per unit effort was higher in burned areas than
	unburned, there was strong support that this pattern was due to a
	higher probability of capture for individuals in burned plots. Within
	the burn, the odds of capturing an individual given it was present
	were 2.06 times the odds outside the burn, reflecting reduced complexity
	of ground cover in the burn. Ther was weak support that true occupancy
	was lower within the burned area. While the odds of occupancy in
	the burn were 0.49 times the odds outside the burn among the five
	species, the magnitude of variation attributed to the burn was small
	in comparison to variation attributed to other landscape variables
	and to unexplained, spatially autocorrelated random variation. While
	ordinary occupancy models may separate the biological pattern of
	interest from variation in detection probability when all sources
	of variation are known, the addition of random effects structures
	for unexplained sources of variation in occupancy and detection probability
	may often more appropriately represent levels of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The distributions of animal populations change and evolve through
	time. Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times
	of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species
	lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal
	variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions.
	In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a
	flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence
	and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory
	model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing
	techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple
	parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of
	the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy
	to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure.
	A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial
	and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns
	are then allowed to "scale up" via ensemble averaging to larger scales.
	This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional
	dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird,
	an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate
	that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the
	Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described
	with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which
	spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate
	that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used
	to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal
	variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern
	Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).},

	Likelihood-based inference is implemented using Markov chain Monte

	by consideration of posterior distributions in a Bayesian setting.
	Maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference are compared
	in an example concerning minke whales in the northeast Atlantic.},
