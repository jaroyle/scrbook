TO COMPILE AND VIEW INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS

Just double click on the buildPreview.bat file in each chapter's
directory

It is important that all filenames reference the scrbook directory (ie
the root directory). So a figure in scrbook/Ch4/Ch4.tex should be
referenced as scrbook/Ch4/figs/somefig.png


TO COMPILE AND VIEW THE ENTIRE BOOK

Run pdflatex and bibtex on previewBook.tex


PARAMETER NAMING:

Detection covariates: greek letter alpha

       alpha0 = logit(p0) = intercept
       alpha1 = coefficient on distance or functio of distance
       alpha2, ..., other covariates

Density covariates: greek letter beta
       beta0 = confounded with data aug parameter psi
       beta1 = first covairate
        etc...

Density model:

 D(x) = beta1*z(x)

Ecological distance covariates:
       theta0, theta1, etc...

Data augmentation:

  psi
  z[i]
