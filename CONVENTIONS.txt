TO COMPILE AND VIEW INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS

Just double click on the buildPreview.bat file in each chapter's
directory

It is important that all filenames reference the scrbook directory (ie
the root directory). So a figure in scrbook/Ch4/Ch4.tex should be
referenced as scrbook/Ch4/figs/somefig.png


TO COMPILE AND VIEW THE ENTIRE BOOK

Run pdflatex and bibtex on previewBook.tex
