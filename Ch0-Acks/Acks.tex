
The project owes a great intellectual debt to Jim Nichols, who has
been an extraordinary mentor and colleague, generously shared his
astounding insight into animal sampling and modeling problems, and
been an all-around helpful guy on all fronts.  We thank Marc K\'{e}ry
for being a great friend and colleague, his creativity and energy in
developing new ideas, presenting workshops, and his engaging
personality.

Special thanks to

(1) Kimberly Gazenski whose support was invaluable. She worked on
administrative, technical and editorial aspects of the whole
project. She maintained the Bibtex database, worked on the GitHub
repository that housed the Latex and R package source trees, edited
Latex files, tested R scripts, did GIS and R programming, analysis,
debugging, and graphics.

(2) Our WCS Tiger program colleagues K. Ullas Karanth and Arjun
Gopalaswamy for continued collaboration on SCR problems, their
support, and friendship.

(3) Sarah Converse, our PWRC colleague, for her interest in SCR
models and developing a number of methodological and application
papers related to multi-session models, providing feedback on some
draft material, and her on-going friendship.

(4) Murray Efford whose R package \mbox{\tt secr} is used throughout the book.
\mbox{\tt secr} is a power package for analyzing spatial capture recapture data and Murray
answered our questions regarding it.

(4) Murray Efford -- he's the man. He answered most of our emails (but not
all), and he wrote the awesome R package \mbox{\tt secr} (note to Murray: this
is not a sarcastic remark).

Martha (Liz) Rutledge (Canada geese data and picture in \ref{chapt.partialID})
Cap Crap data? Fisher data?  Mountain lion data?
