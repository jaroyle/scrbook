
The project owes a great intellectual debt to Jim Nichols, who has
been an extraordinary mentor and colleague, generously shared his
astounding insight into animal sampling and modeling problems, his
knowledge
of the listerature and history of abundance and density estimation
and, most importantly, his extremely valuable time. 
He has 
been extremely helpful guy on all fronts. We are honored that Jim
aggreed to write the Foreword to introduce the book, and to end our
writing of it.
 We thank Marc K\'{e}ry
for being a great friend and colleague, and for his creativity, %and sharing
%with us his
energy, and enthusiasm in developing new ideas and
presenting workshops on hierarchical modeling in ecology.

{\bf Special thanks} to the following people: (1) Kimberly Gazenski whose support was
invaluable. She worked on administrative, technical and editorial
aspects of the whole project. She maintained the \textsc{Bib}\TeX~database,
worked on the GitHub repository that housed the \LaTeX~and \R~package
source trees, edited \LaTeX~files, tested R scripts, did GIS and
\R~programming, analysis, debugging, and graphics;  (2) Our WCS Tiger
program colleagues K. Ullas Karanth and Arjun Gopalaswamy for
continued support and collaboration on SCR problems;  (3) Sarah
Converse, our PWRC colleague, for her interest in SCR models and
developing a number of methodological and application papers related
to multi-session models, providing feedback on draft material, and
friendship;  (4) Murray Efford who introduced spatial
capture-recapture models % XXXX RBC added some stuff here
in his seminal 2004 Oikos paper, and whose \R~package \mbox{\tt secr} is used
throughout the book.  \mbox{\tt secr} is a powerful package for analyzing
spatial capture recapture data and Murray answered our questions as we
were developing applications with it.


We thank the following people for providing data, photographs or figures:
Michael Wegan, Paul Curtis, and Raymond Rainbolt for providing the black bear data from Fort Drum, NY;
Audrey Magoun (wolverine data); Cat Sun and Angela Fuller (black bear
data in Chapter 13); Joshua Raabe and Joseph Hightower (American shad
photo and data in Chapter \ref{chapt.open}); Erin Zylstra (tortoise

data and picture in \ref{chapt.partialID});  {\bf Cap Crap data?
  Fisher data?  Mountain lion data?}.  Jerrold Belant (black bear data
in Chapter \ref{chapt.design}); Theodore Simons, Allan O'Connell,
Arielle Parsons, and Jessica Stocking (raccoon data in Chapter
\ref{chapt.partialID}); Agustin Paviolo (jaguar data in Chapt. 11, and
the cover image).
