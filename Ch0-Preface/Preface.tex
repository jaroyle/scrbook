Capture-recapture (CR) models have been around for well
over a century, and in that time they have served as the primary means of
estimating population size and demographic parameters in ecological
research. The development of these methods has never ceased, and
each year new and useful extensions are presented in ecological and
statistical journals. The seemingly steady clip of development was
recently punctuated with the introduction of spatial capture
recapture (SCR; a.k.a.  spatially explicit capture-recapture models, or SECR)
 models, which in our view stand to revolutionize the
study of animals populations. The importance of this new class of
models is rooted in the fact that they acknowledge that both
ecological processes and observation processes are inherently
spatial. The purpose of this book is to explain this statement, and
to bring together all of the developments over the last few years
while offering researchers practical options for analyzing their own
data using the large and growing class of SCR models.

CR and SCR have been thought of mostly as ways to ``estimate density''
with not so much of a direct link to understanding ecological
processes. So one of the things that motivated us in writing this book
was to elaborate on, and develop, some ideas related to modeling
ecological processes (movement, space usage, landscape connectivity)
in the context of SCR models.  The incorporation of spatial ecological
processes is where SCR models present an important improvement over
traditional, non-spatial CR models.  SCR models explicitly describe
exposure of individuals to sampling that results from the
juxtaposition of sampling devices or traps with individuals, as well
as the ecologically intuitive link between abundance and area, both of
which are unaccounted for by traditional CR models. By including
spatial processes, these models can be adapted and expanded to
directly address many questions related to animal population and
landscape ecology, wildlife management and conservation.  As such, SCR
models stand to revolutionize how researchers study animal
populations.  With such advanced tools at hand, we believe that, but
for some specific situations, traditional closed population models are
largely obsolete, except as a conceptual device.

So, while we do have a lot of material on density estimation in this
book -- this is problem \# 1 in applied ecology -- we worked hard to
cover a lot more of the spatial aspect of population analysis as
relevant to SCR.  There are a lot of books out there that cover
spatial analysis of population structure which are more theoretical or
mathematical, and there are a lot of books out there that cover
sampling and estimation, but that are {\it not} spatial. Our book
bridges these two major ideas as much as is possible as of, roughly,
mid-late 2012.

%XXX RS: Somewhere along the line of edits we seem to have lost the statement that 'space' is one of the central aspects of much of ecological research. I think it's worth emphasizing that in a sentence or two. 



\section*{Themes of this Book}

In this book, we try to achieve a broad conceptual and methodological
scope from basic closed population models for inference about
population density, movement, space usage and resource selection, on
up to open population models for inference about vital rates such as
survival and recruitment.  Much of the material is a synthesis of
recent research but we also expand SCR models in a number of useful
directions, including to the development of explicit models of
landscape connectivity based on ecological or least-cost distance
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.ecoldist}), use of telemetry information to model
resource selection with SCR (Chapt. \ref{chapt.rsf}), and to
accommodate unmarked individuals (Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}),
and many other new topics that have only recently, or not yet at all,
appeared in the literature.  Our intent is to provide a comprehensive
resource for ecologists interested in understanding and applying SCR
models to solve common problems faced in the study of populations.  To
do so, we make use of hierarchical models \citep{royle_dorazio:2008},
which allow great flexibility in accommodating many types of
capture-recapture data. We present many example analyses, of real and
simulated data using likelihood-based and Bayesian methods---examples
that readers can replicate using the code presented in the text and
the resources made available on-line and in our accompanying {\bf R}
package {\tt scrbook}.

The conceptual and methodological themes of this book can be
summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)]  Spatial ecology: Much of ecology is about spatial variation in
  processes (e.g., density) and the mechanisms (e.g., habitat selection, movement) that
  determine this variation. Temporal variation is also commonly of interest and
  we cover this as well, but in less depth.

\item[(2)] Spatial observation error: Observation error is omnipotent in
  ecology, especially in the study of free-ranging vertebrates, and in
  fact the entire 100+ year history of capture-recapture studies have
  been devoted to estimating key demographic parameters in the
  presence of observation error because we simply cannot observe all
  the individuals that are present,
  and we can't know
  their fates even if we mark them all. What has been missing in most
  of the capture-recapture methods is an acknowledgment of the
  spatial context of sampling and the fact that capture (or detection)
  probability will virtually always be a function of the distance
  between traps and animals (or their home ranges).

\item[(3)] Hierarchical modeling: Hierarchical models (HM) are the
  perfect tool for modeling spatial processes, especially those of the
  type covered in this book, where one process (the ecological
  process) is conditionally related to another (the observation
  process). We make use of HMs throughout this book, and we do so
  using both Bayesian and classical (frequentist, likelihood-based)
  modes of inference. These tools allow us to mold our hypotheses into
  probability models which can be used for description, testing, and
  prediction.

\item[(4)] Model implementation: We consider proper implementation of
  the models to be very important throughout the book.  We explore
  likelihood methods using existing software such as the {\bf R}
  package \mbox{\tt secr} \citep{efford:2011}, as well as development
  of custom solutions along the way. In Bayesian analyses of SCR
  models, we emphasize the use of the {\bf BUGS} language for
  describing models.  We also show readers how to devise their own
  MCMC algorithms for Bayesian analysis of SCR models, which can be
  convenient (even necessary) in some practical situations.

\end{itemize}

Altogether, these 
elements
provide for a formulation of SCR models that will allow the reader to
learn the fundamentals of standard modeling concepts and ultimately
implement complex hierarchical models.
We also believe that
while the focus of the book is spatial capture-recapture (that is,
in fact, the title), the reader will be able to apply the general
principles that we cover in the introductory material (e.g., principles
of Bayesian analysis) and even the advanced material (e.g., building
your own MCMC algorithm) to a broad array of topics in general ecology
and wildlife science.
Although we aim to reach a broad audience, at times we go into details
that may only be of interest to advanced practitioners who need to
extend capture-recapture models to unique situations.  We hope that
these advanced topics will not discourage those new to these methods,
but instead
will
allow readers to advance their own
understanding and become less reliant on restrictive tools and
software.


\section*{Computing}

We rely heavily on data processing and analysis in the {\bf R}
programming language, which by now is something that many ecologists
not only know about, but use frequently.  We adopt {\bf R} because it
is free, has a large community that constantly develops code for new
applications, and it gives the user flexibility in data processing and
analyses.  There are some great books out there, including 
\citet{venables_ripley:2002}, \citet{bolker:2008} and \citet{zuur_etal:2009}, and we encourage those
new to \R~to read through the manuals that come with the software.
We use a number of {\bf
  R} packages in our analyses, which are described in Appendix 1, and
moreover, we provide an {\bf R} package containing the scripts and
functions for all of our analyses (see below).

We also rely on the various implementations of the {\bf BUGS}
language including {\bf WinBUGS} \citep{lunn_etal:2000} and {\bf JAGS}
\citep{plummer:2003}.  Because {\bf WinBUGS} is not in active development
any more, we are transitioning to mainly using {\bf JAGS}.  Sometimes
models run better or mix better in one or the other. As a side note,
we don't have much experience with {\bf OpenBUGS}
\citep{thomas_etal:2006}, but our code for {\bf WinBUGS} should run
just the same in {\bf OpenBUGS}. The {\bf BUGS} language provides not
only a computational device for fitting models but it also emphasizes
understanding of what the model is and fosters understanding of how to
construct models.
As our good colleague Marc K\'{e}ry wrote
\citep[][p. 30]{kery:2010}
``{\bf BUGS} frees the modeler in you.''
While we mostly use {\bf BUGS} implementations,
we do a limited amount of developing our own custom MCMC algorithms
(see Chapt. \ref{chapt.mcmc}) which we find very helpful for certain
problems where {\bf BUGS}/{\bf JAGS} fail, or prove to be inefficient.

You will find a fair amount of likelihood analysis throughout the book,
 and we have a chapter that
provides the conceptual and technical background for how to do this,
and several chapters use likelihood methods exclusively. We use the
\R~package \mbox{\tt secr} \citep{efford_etal:2009euring} for many
analyses, and we think people should use this tool because it is polished,
easy to use, fairly general, has the usual {\bf R} summary methods,
and has considerable capability for doing analysis from start to
finish. In some chapters we discuss models that we have to use
likelihood methods for, but which are not implemented (at the time
when we wrote this book) in \mbox{\tt
  secr} (e.g., Chapts. \ref{chapt.ecoldist}, \ref{chapt.rsf}). These
provide 
good examples of why it is useful to understand the principles and to
be able to implement these methods yourself.

\subsection*{The R package {\tt scrbook}}

As we were developing content for the book it became clear that it
would be useful if the tools and data were available for
readers to reproduce the analyses and also to modify so that they can
do their own analysis.  Almost every analysis we did is included as an
{\bf R} script in the \mbox{\tt scrbook} package.
The {\bf R} package will be very dynamic, as we plan to
continue to update and expand it.

The 
package is not meant to be general-purpose, 
flexible software for doing SCR models but, rather, a set of examples
and templates 
illustrating how specific things are done. Code can be used
by the reader to develop methods tailored to his/her situation, or
possibly even more general methods.  Because we use so many different
software packages and computing platforms, we think it's impossible to
put all of what is covered in this book into a single integrated
package.  The \mbox{\tt scrbook} package is for educational purposes
and not for production or consulting work.


\section*{Organization of This Book}

We expect that readers have a basic understanding of statistical
models and classical inference (What is frequentist inference? What is
a likelihood? Generalized linear model? Generalized linear mixed
model?), Bayesian analysis (what is s a prior distribution? and a
posterior distribution?), and have used the {\bf R} programming
environment and maybe even 
the \textbf{BUGS} language.  The ideal candidate for
reading this book has basic knowledge of these topics; however, we do
provide introductory chapters on the necessary components which we
hope can serve as a brief and cursory tutorial for those who might
have only limited technical knowledge, e.g., many biologists who
implement field sampling programs but do not have extensive experience
analyzing data.

To that extent, we introduce Bayesian inference in some detail because
we think readers are less likely to have had a class in that and we
also wanted to produce a stand-alone product.  Because we do
likelihood analysis of many models, there is an introduction to the
relevant elements of likelihood analysis in Chapt. \ref{chapt.mle},
and the implementation of SCR models in the package \mbox{\tt secr}
\citep{efford:2011}.  
Our intent was to provide all of the
material you need in one place, but naturally this led to one of the
deficiencies with the book: it's a little bit long-winded, especially in the first, introductory part.
This should not discourage you, and if you already have extensive
background in the basics of statistical inference, you can skip
straight ahead to the specifics of SCR modeling, starting with Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr0}.

In the following chapters we develop a comprehensive synthesis and
extension of spatial capture-recapture models.  Roughly the first
third of the book is introductory material. In Chapt. \ref{chapt.glms}
we provide the basic analysis tools to understand and analyze SCR
models, namely generalized linear models (GLMs) with random effects,
and demonstrate their analysis in {\bf R} and {\bf WinBUGS}.  
Because SCR models
represent extensions of basic
CR models, we cover
ordinary closed population models in Chapt. \ref{chapt.closed}.


In the 2nd section of the book, we extend
capture-recapture to SCR models
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr0}),
 and discuss a number of different
conceptual and technical topics including tools for likelihood
inference (Chapt. \ref{chapt.mle}), analysis of model fit and model
selection (Chapt. \ref{chapt.gof}), and sampling design
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.design}).
Along with 
Chapts. 
 \ref{chapt.covariates}
and \ref{chapt.poisson-mn}, this part of the book provides the basic
introduction to 
spatial capture-recapture models and their analysis using Bayesian and
likelihood methods.

The 3rd section of the book covers more advanced SCR models.  We have a
number of chapters on spatial modeling aspects related to SCR,
including modeling spatial variation in density
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.state-space}, modeling landscape connectivity or
``ecological distance'' using SCR models
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.ecoldist}), and modeling space usage or resource
selection (Chapt \ref{chapt.rsf}), which includes material on
integrating telemetry data into SCR models.  After this there are a
series of 3 chapters that involve some elements of modeling spatially
or temporally stratified populations.  We cover Bayesian multi-session
models in Chapt. \ref{chapt.hscr}, what we call
``search-encounter'' models in Chapt. \ref{chapt.search-encounter}
and, finally, fully open models involving movement or population
dynamics in Chapt. \ref{chapt.open}.  The reason we view the
search-encounter models chapter, Chapt. \ref{chapt.search-encounter},
as a prelude to fully open models is that these models apply to
situations where we observe the animal locations ``unbiased by fixed
sampling locations'' -- so we get to observe clean measurements of
movement outcomes. When this is possible, we can resolve parameters of
explicit movement models free of those that involve encounter
probability.  For example, one such models has two ``scale''
parameters: $\sigma$ that determines the rate of decay in encounter
probability from a sampling point or line, and $\tau$
which is
the standard deviation of movements about an individuals activity
center.

The final conceptual 4th of this book is what we call
``Super-advanced SCR Models.''
We include a
chapter on developing your own MCMC algorithms for SCR models because
many advanced models require you to do this, or can be run more efficiently than in the {\bf BUGS} language, and we thought some
readers would appreciate a practical introduction to MCMC for ecologists.
Following the MCMC chapter, we have a number
of topics related to unmarked individuals 
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}) or partially marked populations
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.partialID}). This last section of the book contains some research areas that we are
currently developing but lays the foundation for 
further development of novel extensions and applications.


When this project was begun in 2008, the idea of producing a 550 page
book would have been unimaginable -- there wasn't that much material
to work with.  Optimistically, there was maybe a 250 page monograph that
could have been squeezed out of the literature.  But, during the project,
great and new things appeared in the literature, and we developed new
models and concepts ourselves, in the process of writing the book. This includes models of resource selection,
landscape connectivity, and methods for dealing with unmarked
individuals. There are at least 10 chapters in the book that we
couldn't have thought about 5 years ago. We hope that the result is a
timely summary and a lasting resource.
