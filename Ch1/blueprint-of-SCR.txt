Classical  capture-recapture models are largely structure by whether they deal
with closed or open populations and the types of structures modeled
on detection probability.

Closed models:

   Model M0, Mt, Mh, Mb --- all of these models are covered for the
   basic SCR model in Chapter 4 and Chapter 9, in addition to some new
   versions of those models. 
   In chapter 5 we give a basic  framework  for dealing with these models but
   using other encounter process models. C
   


A big criticism of SCR models is that the basic ones assume that density
is constant in space. We deal with generalizations of SCR models to 
get around this in IPP chapter and also in the HSCR chapter. The former
deals with modeling explicit covariates on density that control local
density whereas HSCR chapter deals with modeling variation among independent
studies.
