Two things need to be done in Ch. 1:

(1) We need to talk about our view that SCR models is really going to
 revolutionize the study of animal populations.
  (i) all c-r studies have spatial data
  (ii) historically this was ignored and so really every previous
 study has used the wrong model for inference
 (iii) new technologies generate more and better spatial data
(iv) SCR models allow us to address explicit ecological hypotheses
 about interactions of individuals and about space usage from SPARSE
 and IMPERFECT individual level encounter data


(2) The point of that first subseection is that estimates of N don't mean
anything by themselves.
Not true: Estimates of population size are important especially for
very rare species.

To make any sense at all of N you need to prescribe the area over
which those N individuals live. If you specify N and A then you have
desntiy. But the converse is not true. If you estimate density then it
does not give you estimates of N.

All information is u niquely determined by one of the pairs (D,A) or
(N,A). It is not sufficient to have only D or only N.


Historically people would "make up" a value of A by specifying rules
for things but this was not useful at all because the A that people
made up had not model-based linkage with N. i.e., the estimate of N
was "invariant to A". Yuou always get the same estimate of N.

SCR models resolve this problem by producing estimators of N that
scale -- IN THE MODEL -- with A. 

Ass and Ass-hat.
