the point of that first subseection is that estimates of N don't mean
anything by themselves.
Not true: Estimates of population size are important especially for
very rare species.

To make any sense at all of N you need to prescribe the area over
which those N individuals live. If you specify N and A then you have
desntiy. But the converse is not true. If you estimate density then it
does not give you estimates of N.

All information is u niquely determined by one of the pairs (D,A) or
(N,A). It is not sufficient to have only D or only N.


Historically people would "make up" a value of A by specifying rules
for things but this was not useful at all because the A that people
made up had not model-based linkage with N. i.e., the estimate of N
was "invariant to A". Yuou always get the same estimate of N.

SCR models resolve this problem by producing estimators of N that
scale -- IN THE MODEL -- with A. 

Ass and Ass-hat.
