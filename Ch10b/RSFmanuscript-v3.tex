modeling population size and density.

\section{Introduction}

Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models are relatively new methods for
inference about population density from capture-recapture data using
auxiliary information about individual capture locations
\citep{efford:2004,borchers_efford:2008, royle_young:2008}.  SCR
models posit that $N$ individuals are located within a region denoted
$\mathcal{S}$. Each individual has a home range or activity area
within which movement occurs during some well-defined time interval,
and the center of the animal's activity has Cartesian coordinates
$\mathbf{s}_i$ for individuals $i=1,\ldots,N$. The population is sampled using $J$
traps with coordinates ${\bf x}_{j}$ for $j=1,\ldots,J$, and encounter
probability is expressed as a function of the distance between trap
location (${\bf x}_{j}$), and individual activity or home range center (${\bf
  s}_{i}$).
While SCR models are a relatively recent innovation, their use is already becoming widespread
\citep{efford_etal:2009ecol, gardner_etal:2010jwm,
  gardner_etal:2010ecol,kery_etal:2011, gopalaswamy_etal:2012ecol,
  foster_harmsen:2012} because they resolve critical problems with
ordinary non-spatial capture-recapture methods such as ill-defined
area sampled and heterogeneity in encounter probability due to the
juxtaposition of individuals with traps
\citep{borchers:2011}.
%Furthermore, unlike traditional capture-recapture methods, SCR models
%allow for inference about the processes determining %driving
%spatial variation in population density.

Despite the increasing popularity of SCR models, every
application of them has been based on encounter probability
models, such as the bivariate normal distribution, that imply
symmetric and stationary (invariant to translation) models for home range.
While such simple models might be necessitated in practice by sparse
data,
home range size and shape are often not well represented by stationary
distributions because animals select
resources
that
are unevenly distributed in space. Therefore
more complex models are needed to relate the capture
process with the way in which individuals utilize
space.

In this paper, we extend SCR capture probability models to accommodate
models of space usage or resource selection, by extending them to
include one or more explicit landscape covariates, which the
investigator believes might affect how individual animals use space
within their home ranges (this is what \citet{johnson:1980} called {\it
  third-order} selection). We do this in a way that is entirely
consistent with the manner in which parameters of classical resource
selection functions (RSF) \citep{manly_etal:2002} or utilization
distributions (UD) \citep{worton:1989, fieberg:2005, fieberg:2007} are
estimated from animal telemetry data.  In fact, we argue that SCR
models and RSF/UD models estimated from telemetry are based on the
same basic underlying model of space usage. The important distinctions
between SCR and RSF studies are that (1) resource selection studies do
not result in estimates of population density because models for
telemetry data do not allow for modeling of the encounter process
(i.e., the sample size of individuals is {\it fixed}); and (2) in SCR
studies, encounter of individuals is imperfect (i.e., ``$p<1$'')
whereas, with RSF data obtained by telemetry, encounter is perfect.
With respect to the latter point, we can think of the RSF and SCR
studies as being exactly equivalent either if we have a dense array of
trapping devices, or if our telemetry apparatus samples time or space
imperfectly.  Then, observed use by individuals of trap locations can
be modeled precisely as thinned telemetry data.  Thus, the key
concept of our paper is that, to
 integrate SCR and RSF data, we
formulate both models in a manner which makes them
consistent with respect to some underlying space utilization
process. Telemetry data produce direct observations of space usage,
and SCR data result from a thinning of such data.
%As we will explain, we do this by constructing a model in
%terms of perfect data which are use frequencies for all pixels on a
%landscape over some period of time. We regard telemetry data as
%producing direct observations of these perfect data, and SCR as
%producing a thinned version of the data, where the thinning is
%governed by trap locations.

The modeling framework we develop here simultaneously resolves three
important
problems: (1) it generalizes all existing capture probability models
for SCR data to accommodate realistic patterns of space usage that
result in asymmetric and irregular home
ranges;
(2) it allows estimation of RSF parameters directly from SCR data,
i.e., {\it absent} telemetry data; and (3) it provides the basis for
integrating telemetry data directly into SCR models to improve
estimates of model parameters, including density.  Our model greatly
expands the applied relevance of SCR methods for conservation and
management, and for addressing applied and theoretical questions
related to animal space usage and resource selection.

In the following section we provide an introduction to ordinary
spatial capture-recapture models, followed by a brief discussion of
topics in resource selection models necessary to integrate the two
types of models. A formal development of the combined likelihood for
SCR and telemetry data is given in Sec. \ref{sec.likelihood}, followed
by an application of the new model to a study of black bears in
southwestern New York, and a brief simulation study to evaluate
properties of the parameter estimators based on the combined data. We
conclude with some general discussion, and directions for future work.


\section{Spatial Capture-Recapture}

A number of distinct observation models have been proposed for spatial
capture-recapture studies \citep{borchers_efford:2008,
  royle_etal:2009ecol, efford_etal:2009ecol}, including Poisson,
multinomial, and binomial observation models.
Here we focus on the binomial model in which we suppose that the $J$
traps
are operated for $K$ periods (e.g., nights), and the observations are
individual($i$) and trap ($j$) specific counts $y_{ij}$, which are binomial with
sample size $K$ and encounter probabilities $p_{ij}$ which depend on
trap locations ${\bf x}_{j}$ and individual activity centers ${\bf
  s}_{i}$ as described subsequently.  The vector of trap-specific
counts for individual $i$, ${\bf y}_{i} = (y_{i1},\ldots,y_{iJ})$ is
it's {\it encounter history}.  A standard encounter probability model
\citep{borchers_efford:2008} is the Gaussian model in which
\begin{equation}
\log(p_{ij})= \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2}
\label{eq.encounter}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently,
$p_{ij} = \lambda_{0} \exp(-d_{ij}^{2} /(2\sigma^{2}) )$,
where %$D({\bf x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i}) \equiv D_{ij}$
$d_{ij}$ is the Euclidean
distance between points ${\bf s}_{i}$ and ${\bf x}_{j}$,
$d_{ij} = \|\textbf{s}_i - \textbf{x}_j\| = \sqrt{(s_{i1}-x_{j1})^2 +
  (s_{i2}-x_{j2})^2}$,
and
 $\alpha_{0} = \log(\lambda_{0})$ and $\alpha_{1} = -1/(2\sigma^2)$.
A similar model is the Gaussian hazard model:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{ cloglog}(p_{ij}) = \alpha_{0}  -\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}
d({\bf x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i})^{2} + \alpha_{2}  z({\bf x}_{j})
\label{eq.hazard}
\end{equation}
where $\mbox{cloglog}(u) = \log(-\log(1-u))$ is the complementary
log-log function.
Alternative detection models are used, but all are
functions of Euclidean distance and so we do not consider them
further here.

The primary motivation behind our work is that, in all previous
applications of SCR models, simple encounter probability models based
only on Euclidean distance have been used, with estimation based on
standard likelihood or Bayesian methods. These methods regard the
activity center for each individual $i$, ${\bf s}_{i}$, as latent
variables and remove them from the likelihood either under a model of
``uniformity'' in which ${\bf s} \sim \mbox{Unif}({\cal S})$ where
${\cal S}$ is a spatial region (the ``state-space'' of ${\bf s}$), or
a model in which covariates might affect the spatial distribution of
individuals \citep{borchers_efford:2008}. The state-space ${\cal S}$
defines the potential values for any activity center ${\bf s}$, e.g.,
a polygon defining available habitat or range of the species under
study.

A
potential shortcoming of
standard SCR models is that the encounter
probability model based on Euclidean distance metric is unaffected by
habitat or landscape structure, and it implies that the space used by
individuals is stationary and symmetric, which may be unreasonable in
many applications.  For example, if the common detection model based
on a bivariate normal probability distribution function is used, then
the implied space usage by {\it all} individuals, no matter their
location in space or local habitat conditions, is symmetric with
circular contours of usage intensity.  Subsequently we provide an
extension of this class of SCR models that accommodates asymmetric,
irregular and spatially heterogeneous models of space usage.  Thus,
``where'' an individual lives on the landscape, and the state of the
surrounding landscape, will determine the character of it's usage of
space. In particular, we suggest encounter probability models that
imply irregular, asymmetric and non-stationary home ranges of
individuals and that are sensitive to the local landscape in the
vicinity of an individual's activity center.
%%% NOTE: We use home range center and activity center interchangably
%%% without saying so

\section{Basic Model of Space Usage}
\label{rsf.sec.rsfmodel}

We develop the model here in terms of a discrete landscape purely for
computational expediency. This formulation will accommodate the vast
majority of actual data sets, as almost all habitat or landscape
structure data comes to us in the form of raster data.  Let ${\bf
  x}_{1},\ldots,{\bf x}_{nG}$ identify the center coordinates of a set
of $nG$ pixels that define a landscape.  In SCR studies, a {\it
  subset} of the coordinates ${\bf x}$ will correspond to trap
locations where we might observe individuals whereas, in telemetry
studies, animals are observable (by telemetry fixes) at potentially
{\it all} coordinates.
% XXXX Here we should elaborate on the fact that a pixel is equivalent
% to a trap under this formulation of the model. We probably need
% something in the disucssion too XXXX

% XXXX I moved this down 1 paragraph
%Let $z({\bf x})$ denote a covariate, such as elevation or habitat type,

%individuals move about %wander around

%and their locations accumulate

We will define ``use of ${\bf x}$'' to be the event that an individual
animal appeared in some pixel ${\bf x}$ at any instant in time.
%This
%is equivalently stated in the literature in terms of individual having
%{\it selected} ${\bf x}$.
% XXXX I guess we should avoid use-vs-selection issue here XXXX
As a biological matter, use is the outcome
of individuals moving within their home range
\citep{aarts_etal:2008,johnson_etal:2008,forester_etal:2009,hooten_etal:2010},
i.e., where an individual is at any point in time is the result of
some movement process. However, to understand space usage, it is not
necessary to entertain explicit models of movement, just to observe
the outcomes, and so we don't elaborate further on what could be
sensible or useful models of movement.
\begin{comment}
, but we imagine existing methods
of hierarchical or state-space
models are suitable for this purpose \citep{jonsen_etal:2005,
  forester_etal:2007, patterson_etal:2008, hooten_etal:2010, mcclintock_etal:2012}.
\end{comment}


Let $z({\bf x})$ denote a covariate, such as elevation or habitat type,
measured (or defined) for every
pixel ${\bf x}$. For clarity, we develop the basic ideas here in terms
of a single covariate but, in practice, investigators typically have
more than 1 covariate, which poses no additional problems.
Suppose that an individual is monitored over some period of time
and a fixed number, say $R$, of use observations are recorded.
Let $M({\bf x})$ be the use frequency of pixel ${\bf x}$ for that individual.
i.e., the number of times that individual used pixel ${\bf x}$
during some period of time.
We assume the
following probability distribution for the $nG \times 1$ vector of use
frequencies:
\[
{\bf n} \sim \mbox{Multinom}(R, {\bm \pi})
\]
where ${\bm \pi}$ is the $nG \times 1$ vector of use probabilities
with elements (for each pixel):
\begin{equation}
 \pi({\bf x}) = \frac{ \exp( \alpha_{2} z({\bf x}) ) }
   { \sum_{x}    \exp(\alpha_{2} z({\bf x})) }
\label{rsf.eq.rsf0}
\end{equation}
This is the standard RSF model \citep{manly_etal:2002} used to model
telemetry data.
The parameter $\alpha_2$ is the effect of the
landscape covariate $z({\bf x})$ on the relative probability of
use. Thus, if $\alpha_2$ is positive, the relative probability of use
increases as the value of the covariate increases. In general if
$\alpha_2 \neq 0$ then use is ``selective'' because $z({\bf x})$
is used disproportionately to its availability. We define availability
below, but first we note that in
%In
practice, we don't get to
observe $\{ M({\bf x}) \}$ for all individuals but, instead, only for a small
subset say $i=1,2,\ldots, N_{tel}$, which we capture and install telemetry devices on.
For the telemetered individuals, we assume they behave according
to the same RSF model as the population as a whole, which might be
justified if individuals are randomly sampled from the population.

An animal will typically not be capable of using all the
resources (pixels) in the landscape, and since we cannot know what is
available \textit{a priori}, we need to extend
Eq.~\ref{rsf.eq.rsf0} so that availability can be estimated.
%to make it more realistic spatially and
%also consistent with standard SCR models.
Let ${\bf s}$ denote the
centroid of an individual's home range and let $d({\bf s},{\bf x}) =
||{\bf x} - {\bf s}||$ be the distance from the activity center
${\bf s}$ of some individual to pixel ${\bf x}$, and let $M({\bf
  x},{\bf s})$ denote the use frequency of pixel ${\bf x}$ for an
individual with activity center ${\bf s}$.  We modify the space usage
model to accommodate that space use will be concentrated around an
individual's activity center
\citep{johnson_etal:2008,forester_etal:2009}:
\begin{equation}
 \pi({\bf x}|{\bf s})  = \frac{ \exp( -\alpha_{1} d({\bf x},{\bf s})^{2} +\alpha_{2} z({\bf x}) )}
{ \sum_{x} \exp(-\alpha_{1} d({\bf x},{\bf s})^{2} +\alpha_{2} z({\bf x}))}
\label{rsf.eq.rsf}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_1=1/(2\sigma^2)$ describes the rate at which encounter
probability declines as a function of distance, $d({\bf x},{\bf
  s})$. In terms of availability, if $\alpha_1 \equiv 0$, then all
pixels in the landscape are available, and as $\alpha_1$ increases
home range size decreases such that only the pixels close to the home
range center are available.
From ordinary telemetry data, it would be possible to estimate
parameters $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$ and also the activity centers
${\bf s}$ using standard likelihood methods based on the multinomial
likelihood \citep{johnson_etal:2008}.  We note that this form
(Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}) arises explicitly as a limiting form of the
Gaussian process movement model of
\citet{johnson_etal:2008}. Conceptually, it recognizes that apparent
space usage is a product of both availability (governed here by a
Gaussian kernel) and use conditional on availability. Thus, the
marginal probability of use is a product of the two components
\citep{johnson_etal:2008, forester_etal:2009}.

Note that Eq.~\ref{rsf.eq.rsf} resembles standard encounter models
used in spatial capture-recapture but with an additional covariate
$z({\bf x})$.  The main difference between this observation model and
the standard SCR model is that the model here includes the normalizing
constant $\sum_{x} \exp(-\alpha_{1} d({\bf x},{\bf s})^{2} +\alpha_{2}
z({\bf x}))$, which ensures that the use distribution is a proper
probability density function. Thus we are able to characterize the
probability of encounter in terms of both distance from activity
center and space use.
Note that, under this model for space usage or resource selection, if
there are {\it no} covariates, or if $\alpha_{2} = 0$, then the
probabilities $\pi({\bf x}|{\bf s})$ are directly proportional to the
SCR model for encounter probability.  For example, setting $\alpha_{2}
= 0$, then this implies probability of use for pixel ${\bf x}$ is:
\[
p({\bf x}|{\bf s}) \propto  \exp( -\alpha_{1} d({\bf x},{\bf s})^{2}).
\]
Therefore,
for whatever model we choose for
$p({\bf x},{\bf s})$ in an ordinary SCR model, we can modify the distance
component in the RSF function in Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf} accordingly to
be consistent with that model, by choosing $\pi({\bf x}|{\bf s})$
according to
\[
\pi({\bf x}|{\bf s}) \propto \exp( \log(p({\bf x}|{\bf s})) + \alpha_{2} z({\bf x}))
\]


As an illustration of space usage patterns under this model, we
simulated a covariate that represents variation in habitat structure
(Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.habitat}) such as might correspond to habitat
quality.
This was simulated by using a
 kriging interpolator  of spatial noise.
Space usage patterns for
 8 individuals in this landscape are shown in Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.homeranges},
simulated with $\alpha_{1} = 1/(2\sigma^2)$ with $\sigma = 2$ and the
coefficient on $z({\bf x})$ set to $\alpha_{2} = 1$.
These space usage densities -- ``home ranges'' -- exhibit clear
non-stationarity in response to the structure of the underlying
covariate, and they are distinctly asymmetrical.  We note that if
$\alpha_{2}$ were set to 0, the 8 home ranges shown here would
resemble bivariate normal kernels with $\sigma = 2$.

Another
interesting thing to note is that the activity centers are not
typically located in the pixel of highest use or even the centroid of
usage. That is, the observed ``average'' location is not an unbiased
estimator of ${\bf s}$ under the model in Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}.
This occurs when (and, in this case, because) second order selection
-- the processes determining where activity centers are located on the
landscape -- is {\it independent} of third order selection, which we recognize may
not be the case in practice. In general, we could fit a model in which
$\Pr({\bf s})$ is {\it also} affected by
landscape covariates $z({\bf x})$ \citep{borchers_efford:2008}. This
generality is tangential to our methodological focus, although we fit
such a model in sec. \ref{sec.nybears}.


\subsection{Poisson use model}

A natural way to motivate this specific model of space usage is to
assume that individuals make a sequence of random resource selection
decisions so that the outcomes $M({\bf x})$ (for all ${\bf
  x}$) are marginally {\it
  independent} Poisson random variables:
\[
 M({\bf x})|{\bf s} \sim \mbox{Poisson}( \lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s}))
\]
where
\[
\log(\lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})) = a_{0} -\alpha_{1} d({\bf x},{\bf
  s})^{2} + \alpha_{2} z({\bf x})
\]
In this case, the number of visits to any particular cell is affected
by the covariate $z({\bf x})$ but has a baseline rate ($\exp(a_{0})$)
related to the amount of movement occurring over some time interval.
This is an equivalent model to the multinomial model
(Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}) in the sense that, if we condition on the total
sample size $R = \sum_{x} M({\bf x})$, then the vector of use
frequencies $\{ M({\bf x}) \}$ for individual with activity center
${\bf s}$, has a multinomial distribution with probabilities
\[
 \pi({\bf x}|{\bf s}) = \frac{\lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})}{\sum_{x}
   \lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})}
\]
which is the same as Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf} because $a_{0}$ cancels from
the numerator and denominator of the multinomial cell probabilities
and thus this parameter is not relevant to understanding space usage.
The Poisson formulation also emphasizes that the
observed use frequencies are the product of two components related to
availability (the distance term) and use conditional on availability
(the term related to $z({\bf x})$) \citep{forester_etal:2009}.
Note that if use frequencies are summarized over
$i=1,2,\ldots,N_{tel}$ individuals for each pixel, then a standard
Poisson regression model for the resulting ``quadrat counts'' is
reasonable. This is the model underlying ``Design 1'' in
\citet{manly_etal:2002}.

\subsection{Random Thinning}

Suppose our sampling is imperfect so that we only observe a smaller
number of telemetry fixes than actual use
% XXXX frequency, $n({\bf x})$.
frequencies.
We express this sampling (or ``thinning'') by assuming the observed number of
uses is a binomial random variable based on a sample of size $M({\bf
  x})$:
\[
 m({\bf x}) \sim \mbox{Bin}(M({\bf x}), \phi_{0}).
\]
where $\phi_{0}$
represents the thinning rate, essentially the
sampling effectiveness of the device.
 Then, the marginal distribution of the new random variable $m({\bf x})$ is
 also Poisson
but with mean
\[
 \log(\lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})) = \log(\phi_{0}) + a_{0} -\alpha_{1}
 d({\bf x}|{\bf s})^{2} +  \alpha_{2} z({\bf x}).
\]
 Thus, the space-usage model (RSF) for the
thinned counts $m({\bf x})$ is the same as the space-usage model for the
original variables $M({\bf x})$.  This is because if we remove $M({\bf
x})$
from the conditional
 model by summing over its possible values, then the vector of thinned
 use frequencies
${\bf m}$ (i.e., for all pixels) is {\it also}  multinomial with cell probabilities
\[
\pi({\bf x}|{\bf s}) = \frac{\lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})}{\sum_{x}  \lambda({\bf x}|{\bf s})}
\]
and so the constants $a_{0}$ and $\phi_{0}$
cancel from both the numerator and
denominator. Thus, the underlying RSF model applies to the true
unobserved count frequencies ${\bf n}$ and also those produced
by a random thinning or sampling process, ${\bf m}$.

In summary, if we conduct a telemetry study of $i=1,2\ldots,N_{tel}$
individuals, the observed data are
the $nG \times 1$  vectors of use frequencies
% ${\bf m}_{i}$ XXXX m or n? XXXX
for each individual.
 We declare these data to be
``resource-selection data'' which are typical of the type used to
estimate resource-selection functions (RSFs) \citep{manly_etal:2002}.
In fact, the situation we have described here in which
we obtain a random sample
of use locations and a complete census of available locations is
referred to as ``Design 2'' by \citep{manly_etal:2002}.

\subsection{Resource Selection in SCR Models}

The key to combining RSF data with SCR data is to work with this
underlying resource utilization process and formulate SCR models in
terms of that process.  Imagine that we have a sampling device, such
as a camera trap, in {\it every} pixel. If the device operates
continually then it is no different from a telemetry instrument.  If
it operates intermittently {\it or} does not expose the entire area of
each pixel then a reasonable model for this imperfect observation is
the ``thinned'' binomial model given above.
For data that
arise from SCR studies, the frequency of use for each pixel {\it where}
  a trap is located serves as an intermediate latent variable that we
don't observe. From a design standpoint, the main difference between
SCR studies and telemetry is that, for SCR data, we do not have
sampling devices in all locations (pixels) in the landscape. Rather,
the data are only recorded at a subsample of them, the trap locations,
which we identify by the specific coordinates ${\bf x}_{1},\ldots,{\bf
  x}_{J}$.

So we imagine
that the hypothetical perfect data from a camera trapping study are
the counts $m({\bf x})$ only at the specific trap locations
${\bf x}_{j}$, and for all individuals in the population
$i=1,2,\ldots,N$
(usually $N >> N_{tel}$). We denote the individual- and
trap-specific counts by $m_{ij}$ for individual with activity center
${\bf s}_{i}$ and trap location ${\bf x}_{j}$.
 In practice, many (perhaps most)
of the $m_{ij} \equiv m({\bf x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i})$ frequencies will be 0,
corresponding to individuals not captured in certain traps.
We then construct our SCR encounter
probability model based on the
view that these frequencies $m_{ij}$ are {\it latent} variables. In particular,
under the SCR model with binary observations,
 we observe a random variable
$y_{ij} = 1$  if the individual $i$ visited the pixel
containing trap $j$ and was detected.
We imagine that the observable variable
$y_{ij}$ is related to the latent variable $m_{ij}$ being the
event $m_{ij}>0$. Therefore,
\[
 y_{ij} \sim \mbox{Bern}(p_{ij})
\]
where
\[
 p_{ij} = \Pr(m_{ij}>0) =  1-\exp(- \lambda({\bf x}_{j}|{\bf s}_{i}))
\]
This is the complementary log-log link relating
$p_{ij}$ to $\log(\lambda_{ij})$, setting
$\lambda_{ij} \equiv \lambda({\bf x}_{j}|{\bf s}_{i})$:
\[
 \mathrm{cloglog}(p_{ij}) = \log(\lambda_{ij})
\]
where
\[
 \log(\lambda_{ij} ) = \log(\phi_{0}) + a_{0} -\alpha_{1} d({\bf
   x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i})^{2} +  \alpha_{2} z({\bf x}_{j}).
\]
and we collect the constants so that $\alpha_{0} = \log(\phi_{0}) +
a_{0}$ is the
 baseline encounter rate which includes
the constant intensity of use by the individual and also the baseline
rate of detection, conditional on use.


\section{The combined RSF/SCR Likelihood}
\label{sec.likelihood}

To construct the likelihood for SCR data when we have auxiliary
covariates on space usage or   %%%% {\it or}  XXXX Do you mean 'or' or
                               %%%% 'and'? XXXX  I mean or. We can
                               %%%% have a covariate but NO TELEMETRY
                               %%%% data or we can have the covariate
                               %%%% WITH telemetry data
direct information on space usage
from telemetry data, we regard the two samples (SCR and RSF) as
independent of one another. In practice, this might not always be the
case but it may be reasonable when the telemetry data come from a
previous study or
if telemetered individuals cannot be recognized.
In cases where we {\it
  can} match some individuals between the two samples, regarding them as
independent should only entail a minor
loss of efficiency
because we are disregarding more precise information on a small number
of activity centers. Moreover, we believe, it is unlikely in practice
to expect the two samples to be completely reconcilable and that the
independence formulation is the most
realistic.

Regarding the two data sets as being independent, our approach here
is to form the likelihood for each set of observations as a function
of the same underlying parameters and then combine them. In
particular, let ${\cal L}_{scr}(\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, N;
{\bf y}_{scr})$
be the likelihood for the SCR data in terms of the basic encounter
probability parameters and the total (unknown) population size $N$,
and let ${\cal L}_{rsf}(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}; {\bf m}_{rsf})$ be the
likelihood for the RSF data based on telemetry which, because the
sample size of such individuals is fixed, does not depend on $N$.
Assuming independence of the two datasets, the
likelihood is the product of these two pieces:
\[
{\cal L}_{rsf+scr}(\alpha_{0},\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},N; {\bf y}_{scr},{\bf
  m}_{rsf})  = {\cal L}_{scr} \times {\cal L}_{rsf}
\]
In what follows, we provide a formulation of each likelihood
component. An  {\bf R} \citep{rdevelopmentcoreteam:2004} function for obtaining the maximum likelihood
estimates (MLEs) of
model parameters is given in Appendix 1.

We adopt the notation $f(\cdot)$ to indicate the probability
distribution of whatever observable quantity is in question.
For example, $f(u)$ is
the marginal distribution of $u$ and $f(u|v)$ is the conditional
distribution of $u$ given $v$, etc. We use $g(\cdot)$ to represent the
probability distribution of latent variables.
The observation model for the SCR data for individual $i$ and trap $j$,
from sampling over $K$ encounter periods, is:
\begin{equation}
f(y_{ij}| {\bf s}_{i}) = \mbox{Bin}(K, p_{ij}({\bm \alpha}))
\label{rsf.mle.eq.cond-on-s}
\end{equation}
where
\[
p_{ij}({\bm \alpha})) \equiv  p(d({\bf x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i}), z({\bf x}_{j}); {\bm \alpha})
 = 1-\exp(- \lambda_{ij} )
\]
and
\[
 \lambda_{ij} = \lambda_{0} \exp(- \alpha_{1}
d({\bf x},{\bf s})^{2}
 + \alpha_{2} z({\bf x}_{j}) )
\]
We emphasize that this is conditional on the latent variables ${\bf
  s}_{i}$ (which appear in the distances $d_{ij}$). For these latent variables we
adopt the standard assumption of uniformity, ${\bf s}_{i} \sim
\mbox{Unif}({\cal S})$ for each individual $i=1,2,\ldots,N$
\citep{royle_young:2008} where ${\cal S}$ is the state-space of the
random variable ${\bf s}$.

The distribution of the data for
individual $i$, conditional on ${\bf s}_{i}$, is the product of $J$
binomial terms (i.e., the contributions from each of $J$ traps):
\[
  f({\bf y}_{i} | {\bf s}_{i} , {\bm \alpha}) =
  \prod_{j=1}^{J} \mbox{Bin}(K, p_{ij} ( {\bm \alpha})).
\]
The marginal likelihood \citep{borchers_efford:2008} is
computed by removing ${\bf s}_{i}$, by integration, from the
conditional-on-${\bf s}$ likelihood and regarding the {\it marginal}
distribution of the data as the likelihood. That is, we compute:
\[
  f({\bf y}_{i}|{\bm \alpha}) =
\int_{{\cal S}}  f( {\bf y}_{i} |{\bf s}_{i},{\bm \alpha}) g({\bf s}_{i}) d{\bf s}_{i}
\]
 where, under the uniformity assumption, we have
$g({\bf s}) = 1/||{\cal S}||$.
The likelihood for all $N$ individuals,
is the product of $N$ such terms:
\[
{\cal L}_{scr}({\bm \alpha} | {\bf y}_{1},{\bf y}_{2},\ldots, {\bf y}_{N}) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}
f({\bf y}_{i}|{\bm \alpha})
\]
In practice, we don't know $N$ and so we can't just compute the SCR
likelihood in this manner. Instead, we compute the contributions of
the $n$ observed individuals
directly as given above, but then we have
to compute the likelihood contribution for the ``all 0'' encounter
history, i.e., that corresponding to unobserved individuals.  The
mechanics of computing that are the same as for an ordinary observed
encounter history, requiring that we integrate a binomial probability
of ${\bf 0}$ over the state-space ${\cal S}$:
\[
\pi_{0} = \Pr({\bf y} = {\bf 0}) = \int_{{\cal S}}
  f({\bf 0} | {\bf s} , {\bm \alpha})  d{\bf s}.
\]
We
then have to deal with the issue that $n$
itself is a random variable,
and that leads to the combinatorial term in front of the likelihood
which involves the total population size $N$. This produces the
conditional-on-$N$ or ``binomial form'' of the likelihood
\citep{borchers_efford:2008,royle:2009}:
\[
\frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!}
\left\{ \prod_{i=1}^{n} f({\bf y}_{i}|{\bm \alpha}) \right\}
\pi_{0}^{N-n}
\]

For the RSF data from the sample of individuals with telemetry devices
we adopt the same basic strategy of describing the
conditional-on-${\bf s}$ likelihood and then computing the marginal
likelihood by averaging over possible values of ${\bf s}$.
We have ${\bf m}_{i}$, % XXXX Do you mean 'm' or 'n'? XXXX
the $nG \times 1$ vector of pixel counts for individual $i$,
where these counts are derived from a telemetry study or similar. We
index these elements as $m_{ig}$ for individual $i$ and grid cell $g$,
noting that our index $j$ is reserved only for trap locations, which
are a subset of the $nG$ coordinates ${\bf x}_{1},\ldots, {\bf x}_{nG}$.
The conditional-on-${\bf s}_{i}$ distribution of the telemetry data
from individual $i$ is, omitting the multinomial combinatorial term which does not
depend on parameters,
\[
 f({\bf m}_{i}  | {\bf s}_{i}, {\bm \alpha} ) \propto
\prod_{g=1}^{nG}  \pi({\bf x}_{g}| {\bf s}_{i})^{m_{ig}}
\]
where
\[
 \pi({\bf x}_{g}|{\bf s}_{i})  = \frac{ \exp( -\alpha_{1}
d({\bf x}_{g},{\bf s}_{i})^{2}
 +\alpha_{2} z({\bf x}_{g}) ) }
{ \sum_{g} \exp(-\alpha_{1}
d({\bf x}_{g},{\bf s}_{i})^{2}
+\alpha_{2} z({\bf x}_{g}))}
\]
The marginal distribution is
\[
f({\bf m}_{i}|{\bm \alpha}) =    \int_{{\cal S}}  f({\bf m}_{i} |{\bf s}_{i},{\bm \alpha}) g({\bf s}_{i}) d{\bf s}_{i}
\]
and therefore the likelihood for the RSF data is
\[
{\cal L}_{rsf}({\bm \alpha} | {\bf m}_{1},{\bf m}_{2},\ldots, {\bf m}_{Ntel}) = \prod_{i=1}^{Ntel}
f({\bf m}_{i}|{\bm \alpha}).
\]

A key technical aspect of computing these likelihoods is the
evaluation of the 2-dimensional integral over the state-space ${\cal
  S}$, which we approximate (Appendix 1) numerically by summing over
each point ${\bf x}$ of the landscape.
%%%summation over a fine mesh of points.
% XXXX If we are working with a discrete landscape, then the "fine
% mesh of points" is already defined, right? XXXX
We note also that the binomial form of the likelihood here is
expressed in terms of the parameter
$N$, the population size for the landscape defined by ${\cal
  S}$. Given ${\cal S}$, density is computed as $D({\cal S}) =
N/\mbox{area}({\cal S})$. In our simulation study below we report $N$ as the
two are equivalent summaries of the data once ${\cal S}$ is
defined. \citet{borchers_efford:2008} develop a likelihood based on a
further level of marginalization, in which $N$ is removed from the
likelihood by averaging over a  Poisson prior for $N$.

\section{Application: New York Black Bear Study}
\label{sec.nybears}


We applied our integrated SCR+RSF model to data from a study of black bears in a
region of approximately 4,600 km$^2$ in southwestern New York \citep{sun:2012}.
 The focus of the study was to 1) understand recent
population growth and range expansion by black bears into areas with
higher levels of human density and agriculture than the traditional
range, and 2) evaluate resource selection and movements in relation to
landscape characteristics.  A noninvasive, genetic, mark-recapture
study was conducted to estimate density, and a concurrent telemetry
study was conducted in the same study area to understand patterns of
landscape connectivity and space usage.

Hair snares (n = 103) were set from 6 June - 9 July, 2011 and were
used to obtain DNA to identify individual bears.  Hair snares
consisted of a strand of barbed wire approximately 30 m in length set
around trees at 50cm above flat ground, in forested areas (Woods et
al. 1999), distributed throughout the study area (Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.studyarea}). Hair snares
were baited and scented and checked weekly for hair. Hair samples were
genetically analyzed using 7 microsatellite markers. See Sun (in prep)
for details of the genetic analysis.
 The study yielded
captures of 33 individuals and a total of 14 recaptures (27
individuals captured 1 time only; 3 individuals captured twice; 1
individual each three and four times). Extra trap recaptures included
3 individuals captured in 2 traps, 1 individual in each of 3 and 4
traps.  We used data from 3 radio-telemetered individual bears (2M,
1F) from the same time period as the SCR data. Radio fixes were
obtained approximately once per hour and a total of 1,948 fixes on the
3 individuals were obtained. We thinned these hourly fixes to once per
10 hours to approximate the data as independent movement outcomes,
producing 195 telemetry locations used in the RSF component of the
model.  We use the covariate elevation in the model, derived from a
one arc-second digital elevation model (USGS National Elevation
Dataset, accessed June 2012).  This is shown in
Fig. \ref{fig.elevation} (on a
standardized scale) which also shows the locations of each capture
(multiple captures at a trap location are dithered by adding random
noise).


We fitted a sequence of models based on the Gaussian hazard model
(eq. \ref{eq.hazard})  including an ordinary SCR model with no
covariates or telemetry data, the SCR model with elevation affecting either
$\lambda_{0}$ or density $D({\bf x})$, and models that use telemetry data. We have not discussed modeling
covariate effects on density, but such models are described by
\citet{borchers_efford:2008} and we have not provided any novel
treatment of that modeling aspect here.
The full list of models (with labels) is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Model 1: SCR -- ordinary SCR model
\item[] Model 2: SCR+p(x) -- ordinary SCR model with elevation as a
  covariate on baseline encounter probability $\lambda_{0}$.
\item[] Model 3: SCR+D(x) -- ordinary SCR model with elevation as a
  covariate on density only.
\item[] Model 4: SCR+p(x)+D(x) -- ordinary SCR model with elevation as
  a covariate on both baseline encounter probability and density.
\item[] Model 5: SCR+p(x)+RSF -- SCR model including data from 3
  telemetered individuals.
\item[] Model 6: SCR+p(x)+RSF+D(x) -- SCR model including telemetered
  individuals and with elevation as a covariate on density.
\end{itemize}
The first 4 models can be viewed together for purposes of
model-selection by AIC since they are nested models. The last two
models can be viewed together but cannot be compared to the first 4
because they include telemetry data.
The results of fitting these 6 models -- the parameter estimates and
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab.nyresults}.
We provide a full R script for fitting  all of these models to
simulated data in Appendix 1.


Among models 1-4, those models {\it without} the telemetry data, we
see that the two models with elevation affecting density  are preferred -- and, there is this
large positive response to elevation. This is consistent with the
visual pattern apparent in Fig. \ref{fig.elevation} where we see
individual captures favoring high elevation sites.  We also see a
negative effect of elevation on {\it space usage} (the parameter
$\alpha_{2}$.  It is interesting %and probably worth pointing out
that
the sign of the estimate of $\alpha_{2}$ flips from positive to
negative when we add elevation as a covariate on density. Thus, the
effect of elevation on density appears to have masked its effect on
space usage.  The estimate of $N$ for the 4600 km$^2$ state-space is
about 103 bears $(\exp(4.25)+33)$.

In the two models that include the additional telemetry, a couple
things stand out: Clearly the elevation effect on density is
important, reducing the negative loglikelihood by 5 units. The effect
of elevation on density and space usage are roughly consistent with
Model 4 which didn't have telemetry data. Furthermore, the SEs of
those two parameter estimates are reduced considerably as is the SE
for estimating $\log(\sigma)$.  The SE for estimating $\log(n_{0})$ is

data.

The cool thing about these models is we can make pretty
multi-colored maps of things.  A map of density under the SCR+p(x)+RSF+D(x)
model is shown in fig. \ref{fig.density}.  A map of space usage in
terms of the relative probability of using pixel $x$ relative to the

\section{Simulation Analysis}


We carried-out a simulation study using the landscape shown in
Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.habitat}, and based on populations of size $N=100$ and $N=200$
individuals with activity centers distributed uniformly over the
landscape.  This covariate was simulated by generating a field
of spatially correlated noise to emulate a typical patchy habitat
covariate relevant to habitat quality for a species.  We subjected individuals
to sampling over $K=10$ sampling periods, using a $7 \times 7$ array
of trapping devices located on the the integer coordinates $(u*5,v*5)$
for $u,v = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. The SCR encounter model was of the form
\[
\mbox{ cloglog}(p_{ij}) = \alpha_{0}  -\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}
d({\bf x}_{j},{\bf s}_{i})^{2} + \alpha_{2}  z({\bf x}_{j})
\]
with $\alpha_{0} = -2$ (baseline encounter probability), $\sigma =2$
(scale parameter of the bivariate normal availability model) and
$\alpha_{2} = 1$ (the coefficient on the landscape covariate $z({\bf
  x})$).  In the absence of the covariate $z$, this corresponds to a
RSF that is bivariate normal with standard deviation 2.  These
settings yielded an average of about $n=61$ individuals captured for
the $N=100$ case and about $n=123$ for the $N=200$ case. The latter
case represents what we believe is an extremely large sample size
based on our own experience and thus it should serve to gauge the
large sample bias of the likelihood estimator.


In addition to simulating data from this capture-recapture study, we
simulated 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 telemetered individuals to assess the
improvement in precision as sample size increases.  For all cases we
observed 20 independent telemetry fixes {\it per} individual, assuming
individuals were using space according to a RSF model with the same
parameters as those generating the SCR data. We simulated 500 data
sets for each scenario and, for each data set, we fit 3 models: (i)
the SCR only model, in which the telemetry data were not used; (ii)
the integrated SCR/RSF model which combined all of the data for
jointly estimating model parameters; and (iii) the RSF only model
which just used the telemetry data alone (and therefore $\alpha_{0}$
and $N$ are not estimable parameters).  The focus of the simulations
was to address the following basic questions: (1) how much does the
root mean-squared error (RMSE) of $\hat{N}$ improve as we add or
increase the number of telemetered individuals?  (2) How well does the
SCR model do at estimating the parameter of the RSF with {\it no}
telemetry data?  (3) How much does the precision of the RSF parameter
improve if we add SCR data to the telemetry data?

Results for $N=100$, $N=200$ and $N_{tel}=(2,4,8,12,16)$ are presented
in Table \ref{tab.results1}. We note that the first row of each batch
(labeled ``\mbox{\tt SCR only}'') represent the same estimator and data
configuration. These replicate runs of the SCR-only situation give us
an idea of the inherent Monte Carlo (MC) error in these simulations, which is
roughly about 0.25 and 0.89 on the $N$ scale for the $N=100$ and
$N=200$ cases, respectively.  The mean $N$ for the SCR-only
estimator across all 5 simulations for $N=100$ was
$\mbox{mean}(\hat{N}) = 99.418$, an empirical bias of $0.6\%$. For
$N=200$, the estimated $N$ across all 5 simulations (5 levels of
$N_{tel}$) was $\mbox{mean}(\hat{N}) = 199.712$, an empirical bias of
about $0.15\%$, within the Monte Carlo error of the true value of $N=200$.  The
results suggests a very small bias of $< 1\%$ in the MLE of $N$ for
both the  SCR-only and combined SCR/RSF estimators.  In practice, we
expect a small amount of bias in MLEs as likelihood theory only
guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness.

% Moreover, the landscape resolution is fairly coarse relative
%to $\sigma$ in our study, having a 1 km resolution whereas $\sigma =
%2$, which we expect to introduce a small amount of negative bias
%because it is an explicit under-statement of the true heterogeneity in
%$p$ due to the spatial context of the problem.

In terms of RMSE for estimating $N$, we see that (Table
\ref{tab.results1}), generally, there is about a 5\% reduction in RMSE
when we have at least 2 telemetered individuals. And, although there
is a lot of MC error in the RMSE quantities, it might be as much as a
10\% reduction as the sample size of captured individuals increases
under the higher $N=200$ setting. This incremental improvement in RMSE
of $\hat{N}$
makes sense because, while the
telemetry provides considerable information about the structural
parameters of the model, it provides no information about mean $p$,
i.e. $\alpha_{0}$, which comes only from the SCR data. Thus estimating
$N$ benefits only slightly from the addition of telemetry data.



The MLE of the RSF parameter $\alpha_{2}$ exhibits negligible or no
bias under {\it both} the SCR only and SCR/RSF estimators. It is
well-estimated from SCR data alone and even better than RSF data alone
(in terms of RMSE) until we have more than 200 or so telemetry
observations\footnote{This may appear pardoxical, but the SCR study is
  generating more spatial locations of individuals than the telemetry
  study based on 2 or 4 individuals}.  The biggest improvement from the use of telemetry data
comes in estimating the parameter $\sigma$. We see that $\hat{\sigma}$
is effectively unbiased, and there is a very large improvement in RMSE
of $\hat{\sigma}$, perhaps as much as 50-60\% in some cases, when the
telemetry data are used in the combined estimator (that really doesn't
translate much into improvements in estimating $N$ as we saw
previously).  Improvement due to adding telemetry data diminishes as
the expected sample sizes increases, and so telemetry data does less
to improve the precision of $\hat{\sigma}$ and $\hat{\alpha}_{2}$ for
$N=200$ than for $N=100$. This is because the SCR data alone are
informative about both of those parameters.


The results as they concern likelihood estimation of $N$ suggest that
there is not a substantial benefit to having telemetry
data. Estimators ``SCR only'' and ``SCR/RSF'' both appear
approximately unbiased for $N=100$ and $N=200$, and for any sample
size of telemetered individuals. The RMSE is only 5-10\% improved with
the addition of telemetry information.  However, we find that there is
substantial bias in $\hat{N}$ if we use the {\it misspecified} model
that contains no resource selection component. That is if we leave the
covariate $z({\bf x})$ out of the model and incorrectly fit a model
with symmetric and spatially constant encounter model, we see about
20\% bias in the estimates of $N$ in a limited simulation study that
we carried-out (Table \ref{tab.bias}). As such, accounting for resource
selection is important, even though, when accounted for, telemetry
data only improves the estimator incrementally.
In addition, we find that the importance of telemetry data is
relatively more important for smaller sample sizes. We carried-out one
simulation study for the $N=100$ case but with lower average encounter
probabilities, setting $\alpha_{0}=-3$. This produces
relatively smaller data sets with  $E[n] = 37$. The results are shown
in Table \ref{tab.lowp}. There are some important features evident from
this table. First, as a result of the small samples, the MLE of $N$ is
biased for both SCR only and SCR/RSF estimators although less biased
for the SCR/RSF estimator than for SCR only. The persistent bias in
$\hat{N}$ for both models results from the information about
$\alpha_{0}$ coming only from SCR data, and that estimator itself is
intrinsically biased in small samples.  Conversely, the estimator of
$\alpha_{2}$, the RSF parameter, appears unbiased for all 3 estimators
(SCR only, SCR/RSF and RSF only), as does the estimator of $\sigma$.
We see relatively larger improvements in RMSE (compared with Table
\ref{tab.results1}) of $\hat{N}$, and those improvements
increase substantially as $N_{tel}$ increases.









\section{Discussion}


How animals use space is of
fundamental interest to ecologists, and
important in the conservation and management of many species.
Normally this is done by telemetry and models referred to as resource
selection functions \citep{manly_etal:2002}.
Although spatial capture-recapture models are increasing being used
for estimating density
\citep{efford:2004,borchers_efford:2008, royle:2008,
  efford_etal:2009ecol,royle_etal:2009ecol, gardner_etal:2010ecol,
  gardner_etal:2010jwm, kery_etal:2011,
  sollmann_etal:2011,mollet_etal:2012,gopalaswamy_etal:2012ecol},
until now, they had not been used to understand space usage.
However, it is intuitive that space usage should affect encounter
probability and thus it should be highly relevant to density
estimation in SCR applications. Despite this,
essentially all published applications of SCR models to date have been
based on simplistic encounter probability models that are symmetric
and do not vary across space. One exception is
\citet{royle_etal:2012ecol} who developed SCR models that use
ecological distance metrics (``least-cost path'') instead of normal
Euclidean distance. Here we developed an SCR model in terms of a basic
underlying model of space or resource use that is consistent with
existing views of resource selection functions (RSFs)
\citep{manly_etal:2002}.

In developing the SCR model in terms of an underlying model of space
usage, we achieve a number of useful extensions of existing
SCR and RSF methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] We have shown how to integrate classical RSF data from
telemetry with spatial capture-recapture data based on individual
encounter histories obtained by classical arrays of encounter devices
or traps. This leads to an improvement in our ability to estimate
density, and also an improvement in our ability to estimate parameters
of the RSF function.  Thus, the combined model is both an extension of
standard SCR models and also and extension of standard RSF models. As
many animal population studies have auxiliary telemetry information,
the ability to incorporate such information into SCR studies has
enormous applicability and
benefits.
While adding RSF data to SCR data may increase precision of the MLE of $N$
only incrementally, the effect can be more substantial in sparse data sets
and, generally, RSF produces
relatively huge gains in precision in the MLE of $\sigma$.
\item[(2)] We have shown that one can estimate RSF model parameters
directly from SCR data {\it alone}.
While further exploration of this point
is necessary,
it does establish clearly that SCR
models {\it are} explicit models of space usage. Because
capture-recapture studies are, arguably, more widespread than
telemetry studies alone, this greatly broadens the utility and
importance of data from those studies.
\item[(3)] It is also now clear
that one of the important parameters of SCR models, that controlling
``home range radius'', can be directly estimated from telemetry data
alone.
The combined RSF+SCR model does yield large improvements in estimation
of $\sigma$. As a practical matter, this suggests we could estimate
$\sigma$ entirely from data extrinsic to the SCR study which might
provide great freedom in the design of SCR studies. For example, traps
could be spaced far enough apart to generate relatively few (even no) spatial recaptures,
but dramatically increase the coverage of the population, i.e., the
observed sample size of captured individuals relative to $N$.
\item[(4)] Finally, we found that an
ordinary SCR model with symmetric encounter probability model produces
extremely biased estimates of $N$ when the population of individuals
does exhibit resource selection, consistent with bias induced by
heterogeneity in $p$ in ordinary model $M_{h}$
\citep{dorazio_royle:2003}. This is because the effect of resource
selection by individuals is to induce heterogeneity in encounter
probability as a result of heterogeneity in the landscape.
  As such, it is important to account
for space usage when important covariates are known to influence
space usage patterns.
\end{itemize}


Use of telemetry data in capture-recapture studies has been suggested
previously. For example, \citet{white_shenk:2001} and
\citet{ivan:2012} suggested using telemetry data to estimate the
``probability that an individual is exposed to sampling'' but
their estimator requires that individuals are sampled in proportion to
this unknown quantity, which seems impossible to achieve in many
studies. In addition, they do not directly integrate the telemetry
data with the capture-recapture model so that common parameters are
jointly estimated.
 \citet{sollmann_etal:inprepjapplecol}
 used telemetry data to estimate directly the parameter $\sigma$ from
 the bivariate normal SCR model in order to improve estimates of
 density. They recognized the relationship between SCR models and
 models of space usage, but their model did not include an explicit
 resource selection component.




\subsection{Black Bear Application}

% XXXX The next few paragraphs might be better in the Intro XXXX

hierarchical orders (Johnson 1980), from selection of a geographical
% XXXX None of the citations below are in the bib file! XXXX
area (first-order selection), selection of a home range within a study
area (second-order), or selection of resources with that home range
(third-order).  Animals may select resources at different scales as a
result of variability in the distribution of resources on the
landscape (Mayor et al. 2009).  Indeed, black bears make habitat
selection decisions at multiple spatial scales, and decisions made at
the second-order can differ from those at the third-order (Lyons et
al. 2003, Sadeghpour and Ginnett 2011).  As a result of multi-scale
resource selection, we can expect that the modeled covariates
(elevation in our example) may affect density and space usage
differently.  We suggest that density is operating at the second-order
and is largely related to the spacing of individuals and their
associated home ranges across the landscape.  Our RSF was defined
based on selection of resources within the home range (second-order).
Because density and our second-order RSF were at different spatial
scales, there is no expectation that the modeled covariate describing
space usage (elevation) would influence each in a similar manner.
Consistent with our positive relationship between elevation and
density, the distribution of a black bear population in the central
Appalachian Mountains was positively associated with elevation (Frary
et al. 2011).  At the second-order, however, we observed a negative
effect of elevation on space usage.  Our study was conducted during
summer, and seasonal shifts in elevation have been widely documented
in black bears, often attributed to seasonal variation in food
availability (Reynolds and Beecham 1980, Garshelis and Pelton 1981,
Kendall 1983, Graber and White 1983, Irwin and Hammond 1985, Raine and
Kansas 1990).  The negative relationship between elevation and space
usage during the summer could be attributable to either access to food
resources at lower elevations, or access to river and stream
corridors.  Within their home ranges, black bears selected areas with
high stream densities (Fecske et al. 2002), and in our study area,
lower elevations were associated with river corridors which likely
provided bears cooler conditions during the heat of summer.




\subsection{Extensions and Future Work}


We developed a formal analysis framework here based on marginal
likelihood \citep{borchers_efford:2008}.  In principle, Bayesian
analysis does not pose any unique challenges for this new class of
models although we expect some loss of computational efficiency due to
the increased number of times the components of the likelihood would
need to be evaluated.  We imagine that some problems would benefit
from a Bayesian formulation, however. For example, using an open
population model that allows for recruitment and survival over time
\citep{gardner_etal:2010ecol} is convenient to develop in the {\bf
  BUGS} language and incorporating information on unmarked individuals
has been done using Bayesian formulations of SCR models
\citep{chandler_royle:2012, sollmann_etal:inprepjapplecol} but, so far, not
likelihood methods.

Bayesian analysis might have an advantage in situations where the
landscape is characterized by a very fine covariate raster, or even
continuous covariates, because the individual activity centers can be
updated in the MCMC algorithm by evaluating the likelihood conditional
on a single candidate value of ${\bf s}$ for each individual.
Conversely, evaluating of the marginal likelihood becomes tedious and
memory intensive as the size of the raster increases and so some
effort has to be made to efficiently calculate the likelihood in such
cases \citep[e.g., see][]{warton_shepherd:2010}. Independent of its
effect on integration, raster size is itself an important practical
concern.
Whenever we have explicit spatial covariates, it is possible that
selection is occurring at a much finer resolution than is required to
effectively integrate the likelihood over the state-space of ${\bf
  s}$. In this case, too coarse of a raster will likely cause biased
parameter estimates (having an effect analogous to measurement error
in regression, we suspect). Too fine, however, creates concomitant
effects on computing and memory requirements.  Choice of raster size
or spatial resolution is thus both a fundamental scientific question,
but also very much a practical computing issue.


In our formulation of the combined likelihood for RSF and SCR data, we
assumed the data from capture-recapture and telemetry studies were
independent of one another. This implies that whether or not an
individual enters into one of the data sets has no effect on whether
it enters into the other data set. We cannot foresee situations in
which violation of this assumption should be problematic or invalidate
the estimator under the independence assumption.  In some cases it
might so happen that some individuals appear in {\it both} the RSF and
SCR data sets. In this case, ignoring that information should entail
only an incremental decrease in precision because a slight bit of
information about an individuals activity center is disregarded.
%Heuristically, an SCR observation (encounter in a trap)
%is like one additional telemetry observation, and so the
%misspecification (independence)
%regards the
%two pieces of information as having separate activity centers.
% Our model pretends that we don't know anything
%about the telemetered individuals in terms of their encounter history
%in traps.  In principle it shouldn't be difficult to admit a formal
%reconciliation of individuals between the two lists. In that case, we
%just combine the two conditional likelihoods before we integrate ${\bf
%  s}$ from the conditional likelihood. This would be almost trivial to
%do if {\it all} individuals were reconcilable (or none as in the case
%we have covered here) but, in general , we think you will always have
%an intermediate case -- i.e., either none will be or at most a subset
%of telemetered individuals will be known. More likely you have variations of ``well, that
%guy looks telemetered but we don't know which guy it is....hmmm'' and
%that case, basically a type of marking uncertainty or
%misclassification, is clearly more difficult to deal with.

We used an RSF model for telemetry data that is most suitable for
independent observations of space usage.  This would be reasonable if
telemetry fixes are made reasonably far apart in time, or if the
telemetry data %stream
is thinned, as we did in our analysis of the
black bear data.  However, use of the independence model for
non-independent data is probably only a minor problem for estimating
density or other model parameters because we expect that the pixel use
frequencies should remain unbiased in this case\footnote{As a
  technical matter, we think regular movement models should exhibit an
  ergodic property analogous to standard MCMC algorithms, time-series
  models and related dynamical systems.}.  We imagine that precision
should be over-stated for the parameters of the RSF model because the
sample size is not reflecting the dependence of the observations.  In
general, however, it will be desirable to incorporate more general (or
explicit) models of movement into the framework proposed here, so that
SCR models can be used to improve inferences about animal movement,
and because more explicit models may improve inferences about density
obtained by capture-recapture studies.  As we noted, our specific model
of independence corresponds to a limiting case of the Gaussian process
movement model \citep{johnson_etal:2008}, but including the general
RSF movement model for correlated data from \citet{johnson_etal:2008}
should not pose any difficulty in terms of constructing the combined
SCR+RSF likelihood (but contain one additional parameter).



\subsection{Conclusion}

We conclude that the key benefit of our combined SCR/RSF model is its
ability to integrate realistic patterns of space usage directly into SCR
models and avoid
bias in estimating $N$ and, secondarily, we
are able to obtain RSF information from SCR alone.  Therefore, our new
class of integrated SCR/RSF models allows investigators to model how
the landscape and habitat influence movement and space usage of
individuals within their home range, using non-invasively collected
capture-recapture data or capture-recapture data augmented with
telemetry data.  This should improve our ability to understand, and
study, aspects of space usage and it might, ultimately, aid in
addressing conservation-related problems such as reserve or corridor
design. And, it should greatly expand the relevance and utility of
spatial capture-recapture beyond simply its use for density
estimation.
