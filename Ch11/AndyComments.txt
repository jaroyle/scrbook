a few  instances  of  "intensity  parameter"  --  isn't  this  usually  called
"intensity function"?


about 18 lines prior to section 13.1 you could write "..by treating
the intensity as a function of covariates..."

paragraph starting "Another difference....." I think the key point
here is that under the binomial model, the bin counts are not
independent  CONDITIONAL ON the total.  I didn't think that was
clearly said. 

line right after the bit of R code: "dependence among [ADD] bin or
quadrat [/ADD] counts..."

In general, should we use "bin" or "quadrat"  instead of
"pixel"? [note: I have used pixel in SCR0 but I think the term is not
quite right in that context -- the same as here -- either]. Note 2: I
also use "bin" terminology in the GoF chapter where I talk about the
standard GoF test for "randomness" 

3 lines after the bit of R code: "pixels" should be "pixel" -- and
again, I think bin/quadrat is better than pixel but we should go all
or none on this across all chapters. Lets discuss briefly. 

18 lines after the bit of R code: here you are alluding to the
difference between realized vs expected N/density or whatever. I think
there should be a pointer here to the (now empty) subsection of
chapter SCR0 where we will talk about this. 

near the end of 13.1  you have a comment enclosed in XXXX where you
ask if thinned point process is also binomial. Yes it is . but it is a
binomial process then with M instead of N. 
Thus,
I would say here that the point process conditional on N is
a BPP but the thinned point process is a BPP with parameter M now
instead of  N. 


13.2:  14 lines after eq 13.2.1: "and multiplying it by the area of
the pixel." 
I'm confused by this -- isn't 13.2.1 E[n] directly?  i.e., it it IS
the expected number of individuals in the pixel, you don't have to
scale it by anything......

around eq. 13.2.5:  Lots of "Chapter" spelled out -- change to Chapt.  

same general place you use "technically unjustified" which I don't
understand the meaning of. 

around Eq. 13.2.6 there should be a reference forward to the
"multi-session" models chapter where we will discuss this issue in
some detail (i.e., the equivalence of psi with beta0). 

paragraph before section "Observed point processes" -- there is a
bunch of 4 unnumbered equations: reverse the x_{j} and s_{i} so the
x_{j} comes first.

throughtout the chapter: you have covariate ELEV(s) -- I think we
agreed to set this in {\tt } and I can't remember if it should be {\tt
Elev}(s) or perhaps {\tt elev}(s) -- but lets standardize one way or
the other.   

at the end of section 13.4.1 you talk about realized vs. expected
again and the difference in uncertainty in the two pieces. I think a
key point is this. The realized N is the sum of 2 parts: n + n0 
and we get to observe n -- there is no variation about it, and the
variance of n0 is a function of estimation error of the parameters
but also the magnitude of n0 itseelf. i.e., as n0 --> 0, then
Var(n0-hat) --> 0 too.  Anyhow, the point is that Var(realized N) is
small because part of N is observed. 

13.4.2:  can you rename the function "ch11"?

"panel 13.1" should be "Panel 13.1"

can you rename "ch9secrYjags"?

just before paragraph starting "A question that arises is...." you
have this issue with LCD < ED if theta < 0.  I'm not sure I agree with
this point. 
If cost(x,x') = exp( theta * deltaZ(x,x') ) 
then the value/sign of theta is immaterial to your argument in the
sense that cost is always positive, and theta > 0 means it is an
increasing function of change-in-Z and theta < 1 means it is a
decreasing function. Both are sensible.
If z(x) is elevation or ruggedness then I think you should have a
negative response -- i.e. cost decreases so theta < 0.


Figure 13.6 -- the jaguar study area protection status. Can you do a
[ht] position on this to get it to compile on a page with text, so its
not alone on its own page?


Where you have "WAITING ON FINAL RESULTS" just above that there needs
to be a space after "scrbook" and before "on"

sec 13.7: call this "SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK" to be consistent -- and also
b/c its not just a summary but some pointers to the future and other
stuff.

13.7: maybe a sentence in here about building the mother of all SCR
models having RSF + connectivity + IPP structure?

BTW, did you use the term "connectivity" earlier in the chapter?
