\begin{comment}
Up to this point we have developed many variations of SCR models to
describe the observation process.  These included models of the
relationship between encounter probability and distance, and different
types of covariates such as behavioral responses that can affect
detection probability.  Although these different observation models
are immensely useful, they are rather basic in the sense that they
imply simplistic models of how individuals use space (Sec.
\ref{scr0.sec.implied}) and how individuals are distributed in space.
Here,  we generalize the SCR modeling framework to accommodate more
realistic notions of how animals use space.
\end{comment}


In Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr0} we briefly discussed the notion of how
SCR encounter probability models relate to models of space usage.
When using symmetric and stationary encounter probability models, SCR
models imply that space usage is a decreasing function of distance
from an individuals home range center. This is not a very realistic
model in most applications.  In this chapter, we extend SCR
models to incorporate models of resource selection,
such as when
one or more explicit landscape covariates are available which the
investigator believes might affect how individual animals use space
within their home range (this is what \citet{johnson:1980} called {\it
  third-order} selection).  
  
  %XXXX Rahel: I think, out of context third order selection doesnt really mean much; why not briefly state what first and second order selection is? %If I remember right, it's selection on the population level, and selection of home range location within the landscape,right? XXX
  
%  XXXX I don't really like this following section.  
%  XXXX Can we make the language separate from the paper?

Our treatment follows
\citet{royle_etal:2012mee} which integrated a standard family of
resource selection models based on auxiliary telemetry data into the
capture-recapture model for encounter probability.
%, and we reproduce
%their case study here in Sec.
%\ref{rsf.chapt.nybears}.
%  The extension of SCR models
%they proposed is consistent with the manner in which classical
%``resource selection function'' (RSF) models \citep{manly_etal:2002}
%or utilization distributions \citep{worton:1989, fieberg:2005,
%  fieberg:2007} are estimated from animal telemetry data.
They  argued that SCR models and resource
selection models \citep{manly_etal:2002} are based on the same basic
underlying model of space usage. The important distinction between SCR
and RSF studies is that, in SCR studies, encounter of individuals is
imperfect (i.e., ``$p<1$'') whereas, with RSF data obtained by
telemetry, encounter is perfect. 
SCR and telemetry data on resource selection can be combined in the
same likelihood by formally recognizing this distinction in the model.  
%We can think of the two as being exactly
%equivalent either if we have a dense array of trapping devices, or if
%our telemetry apparatus is imperfect such as only samples a small area
%of space (this would be consistent with telemetry stations for
%sampling fish which only measure passage at points along a stream or river).

There are two important motives for considering a formal integration
of RSF models with capture-recapture. The first is to integrate models
of resource use by individuals with models of population size or
density. There is relatively little in the literature on this topic,
although \citet{boyce_mcdonald:1999} describe a procedure where (an
estimate of) population size is used to scale resource selection
functions to produce a XXXpopulation?XXX density surface. The second reason is because
this allows for the integration of auxiliary data from telemetry
studies with capture-recapture data.  Telemetry studies are extremely
common in animal ecology for studying movement and resource selection,
and capture-recapture studies frequently involve a simultaneous
telemetry component.  Telemetry data has been widely used in
conjunction with capture-recapture data using standard non-spatial
models.  For example, \citet{white_shenk:2001} and \citet{ivan:2012}
suggested using telemetry data to estimate the probability that an
individual is exposed to capture-recapture sampling. However, their estimator requires
that individuals are telemetry-tagged in proportion to this unknown quantity,
which seems impossible to achieve in many studies. In addition, they
do not directly integrate the telemetry data with the
capture-recapture model so that common parameters are jointly
estimated.  \citet{sollmann_etal:inprepjapplecol} and
\citet{sollmann_etal:2012ecol} used telemetry data to directly inform
the parameter $\sigma$ from the bivariate normal SCR model in order to
improve estimates of density, although these models do not include an
explicit resource selection component.

Formal integration of capture-recapture with telemetry data for the
purposes of modeling resource selection has a number of immediate
benefits. For one, telemetry data provide direct information about
$\sigma$
\citep{sollmann_etal:2012ecol,sollmann_etal:inprepjapplecol}. As a
result, this leads to improved estimates of model parameters, and also
has design consequences (see Sec. \ref{design.sec.telemetry}).  In
addition, active resource selection by animals induces a type of
heterogeneity in encounter probability, which is misspecified by
standard SCR encounter probability models. 
% XXX Maybe add some example here; something like: Imagine a camera-trap located some distance $d$ from an individual's activity center in a preferred habitat, say $H1$, and another camera trap the same distance from $s_i$ but in a habitat that is infrequently used by the study species, say $H2$. Then, intuitively, we would expect to photograph $i$ more frequently at the camera trap located in $H1$, simply because it spends more time there. XXX  
As a result, estimates of
population size or density under models that do not account for
resource selection can be biased \citep{royle_etal:2012mee}.  Finally,
because the resource selection model translates directly to a model
for encounter probability for spatial capture-recapture data, the
implication of this is that it allows us to estimate resource
selection model parameters directly from SCR data, i.e., {\it absent}
telemetry data. This fact should broaden the practical relevance of
spatial capture-recapture not just for estimating density, but also
for directly studying movement and resource selection.








\section{A Model of Space Usage}

\label{rsf.sec.rsfmodel}


Assume that the landscape is defined in terms of a discrete raster of
one or more covariates, having the same dimensions and extent.  Let
${\bf x}_{1},\ldots,{\bf x}_{G}$ identify the center coordinates of
$G$ pixels that define a landscape, organized in the 
 matrix ${\bf X}_{G \times 2}$.  Let $C({\bf x})$ denote a
covariate defined for every pixel ${\bf x}$.  We suppose
that individual members of a population wander around space in some
manner related to the covariate $C({\bf x})$.
%We will define ``use
%of ${\bf x}$'' to be the event that an individual animal appeared in
%some pixel ${\bf x}$ during some prescribed, but arbitrary, time
%interval. Truth
%therefore exists, at least as it
%relates to space usage by an individual.

% XXX  I am not a fan of the "use decision" term.  I think it's just
% use.  You define the movement of an animal from pixel x to x'
% as a decision, which is okay, but that's not what is modeled here...
% R is not really the total number of use decisions, it's just use, right?
% The model has no transition component from pixel x to x'
As a biological matter, use is the outcome of individuals moving
around their home range \citep{hooten_etal:2010}, i.e., where an
individual is at any point in time is the result of some movement
process. However, to understand space usage, it is not necessary to
entertain explicit models of movement, just to observe the outcomes,
and so we don't elaborate further on what could be sensible or useful
models of movement, but we imagine existing methods of hierarchical or
state-space models are suitable for this purpose
\citep{ovaskainen:2004, jonsen_etal:2005, forester_etal:2007,
  ovaskainen_etal:2008, patterson_etal:2008, hooten_etal:2010,
  mcclintock_etal:2012}.  We consider explicit movement models in the
context of SCR models later chapters of this book
(Chapts. \ref{chapt.search-encounter} and \ref{chapt.open}).  Here we
adopt more of a phenomenological formulation of space usage as
follows: If an individual appears in pixel ${\bf x}$ at some instant,  
this is defined as a decision to ``use'' pixel ${\bf
  x}$. 
%XXX RS: This section on truth is a little cryptic. Maybe just needs some re-wording. Plus I agree with reviewer 1 on the use decision terminology XXX
This also induces a definition of ``truth'' -- that is, over
any prescribed time interval, the percentage of time individual spends
in each pixel is theoretically knowable. Or, if we sample some number
of points during that interval, say $R$, 
then the frequency of use decisions is,
 conceivably, observable by some
omnipotent accounting mechanism (e.g., telemetry that doesn't malfunction).
%%%%  XXX need to check notation consistent with chapter 5 XXXX
%%% There , , ,  we use "m" for true use frequency, so this is good
In this
case, let $m_{ij}$ be the {\it true} use frequency of pixel $j$ by
individual $i$ -- i.e., the number of times individual $i$ used pixel
$j$.  We assume the vector of use frequencies ${\bf m}_{i} =
(m_{i1},\ldots,m_{iG})$ has a multinomial distribution:
\[
{\bf m}_{i} \sim \mbox{Multinomial}(R, {\bm \pi}_{i})
\]
where $R = \sum_{j} m_{ij}$ is the total number of ``use decisions''
made by individual $i$ and
\[
 \pi_{ij} = \frac{ \exp( \alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}) ) }{ \sum_{x}
   \exp(\alpha_{2} C({\bf x}))}
\]
This is a standard RSF model \citep{manly_etal:2002} used to model
telemetry data. In particular, this is ``protocol A'' of
\citep{manly_etal:2002} where all available landscape pixels are censused (i.e., known without error), and
used pixels are sampled randomly for each individual.
\begin{comment}
One thing about Manly et al 2002 is that they offer
  numerous ways of modeling resource selection. They offer three
  ``protocols'' (pg 5) describing how used and unused resources are
  sampled. What we are discussing is their protocol A where all
  available resources (pixels) are censused, and used pixels are
  sampled randomly for each individual. They also describe 3 designs
  that vary in whether or not individual level data is collected. I
  think it is just worth being aware of this stuff because everybody
  that talks about RSFs thinks in these terms.
\end{comment}
The parameter $\alpha_2$ is the effect of the
landscape covariate $C({\bf x})$ on the relative probability of
use. Thus, if $\alpha_2$ is positive, the relative probability of use
increases as the covariate increases.

% XXX RS: What about the difficulties of defining 'availability'? It's a big issue in RSF and I think it's worth mentioning. Because it means defining a spatial area that's potentially available to an individual (or a population, depending on the protocoll); and I think it's kind of a spatial problem similar to defining the effective sampled area in traditional CR. Anyway, I think it would be good to at least mention this issue since we're all about the space... XXX

In practice, we don't get to observe $m_{ij}$ for all individuals but,
instead, only for a small subset which we capture and telemeter.  
For the telemetered individuals, we assume
they use resources according to the same RSF model as the population as
a whole.  To extend this model to make it more realistic, and
consistent with the formulation of SCR models, let ${\bf s}$ denote
the center of an individual's home range and let $d_{ij} = ||{\bf
  x}_{j} - {\bf s}_{i}||$ be the distance from the home range center
of individual $i$, ${\bf s}_{i}$, to pixel $j$, ${\bf x}_{j}$. We
modify the space usage model to accommodate that space use will be
concentrated around an individual's home range center:
\begin{equation}
 \pi_{ij} = \frac{ \exp( -\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2} +\alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}) ) }
{ \sum_{x} \exp(-\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2} +\alpha_{2} C({\bf x}))}
\label{rsf.eq.rsf}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_1=1/(2\sigma^2)$ describes the rate at which capture
probability XXXX space usage?? XXXX declines as a function of distance from $s_i$.  The parameters
$\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$ and the activity centers ${\bf s}$ can be
estimated directly from telemetry data, using standard
likelihood methods based on the multinomial likelihood
\citep{johnson_etal:2008}.
%We note that this form
%(Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}) arises explicitly as a limiting form of the
%Gaussian process movement model of
%\citet{johnson_etal:2008}. C
%XXX RS: This last sentence is again kind of cryptic without a little more background. Actually, maybe just turning it into 2-3 sentences and being more explicit about what 'which' stands for, would help. Also, I don't know about the 'RSF modeling activities'. Isn't that more a question of how we want to describe our landscape - discrete or continuous? XXX
Sometimes in RSF modeling activities there are continuous
covariates and so the denominator in Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf} involves 
integration over a distribution for the covariate, which is the
conditional intensity of observed point locations in a point process
model. 



The model Eq.~\ref{rsf.eq.rsf} can be understood as a compound model
of space usage governed by distance-based ``availability'' according
to a Gaussian kernel, and also ``use'', conditional on availability
\citep{johnson_etal:2008, forester_etal:2009}.  
% XXX RS: I know I like to be super explicit about things, but these chapters contain so much new information that I think it helps putting examples in. So, maybe somethinge here like: 'In other words, we consider a pixel to be less available to an individual if it is located further away from $s_i$'. The I'd also add in another part about the use, maybe that it is conditional on availability and the RSF? I think this is kind of the core of this model so it wouldn't hurt spending a few more sentences on the two components. XXXXX
Further,
Eq.~\ref{rsf.eq.rsf} resembles standard SCR encounter probability
models that we have used previously, but here the model includes an additional
covariate $C({\bf x})$ (and see Chapt. \ref{chapt.poisson-mn}).  In
particular, under this model for space usage or resource selection, if
we have no covariates at all, or if $\alpha_{2} = 0$, then the
probabilities $\pi_{ij}$ are directly proportional to the SCR model
for encounter probability.  Therefore, setting $\alpha_{2} = 0$, 
the probability of use for pixel $j$ is:
\[
p_{ij} \propto  \exp( -\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2}).
\]
% XXXX RS: So far you have only talked about a model for space usage, not encounter prob. in the sense of imperfect detection. It might be worthwhile to point out that you're talking about the shape of the 'detection-with-distance' model (colloquially speaking) but are not yet concerned with the imperfect detection part. I just think otherwise things could get a little confusing for the reader. Or, maybe point out earlier and more clearly the connection between encounter probability and space usage - that one is just a downscaled version (or proportion) of the other. XXX
Clearly, whatever function of distance we use in the RSF model implies
an equivalent model of space usage (Sec. \ref{scr0.sec.implied}) as an
SCR model for encounter probability.  In particular, for whatever
model we choose for $p_{ij}$ in an ordinary SCR model, we can modify
the distance component in the RSF function in Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}
accordingly to be consistent with that model 
by using whatever function $p_{ij}$ we choose according to
%XXXRS: this sentence is off - too many according to, accordingly, etc. But not sure how to fix it. XXXXX
\[
\pi_{ij} \propto \exp( \log(p_{ij}) + \alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}) )
\]
(see \citet{forester_etal:2009}).  One difference between this
observation model and those that we have considered in previous
chapters is that it includes the normalizing constant $\sum_{x}
\exp(-\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2} +\alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}))$, which
ensures that the use distribution is a proper probability density
function. In that sense, the model has the same form as the
multinomial SCR model described in Chapt. \ref{chapt.poisson-mn}
except that, here, the density 
%XXXRS: probability density of a location? just so the reader doesnt confuse it with animal density, which also conerns all of S XXXX
is with respect to the whole state
space ${\cal S}$, not just the subset of trap locations. In a sense,
we view telemetry data as a perfect sampling of space, equivalent to
having a trap in each pixel, and the number of captures (uses by an
individual) is fixed by design.
%XXX isn't this really similar to the multinomial observation model?

\citet{royle_etal:2012mee} depict some typical space
usage patterns under the above described model for a single simulated covariate 
(reproduced here in Fig.~\ref{rsf.fig.homeranges}).
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in,height=3.5in]{Ch13-RSF/figs/homeranges8}
\caption{Space usage patterns of 8 individuals under a space usage
  model that contains a single covariate which is shown in
  Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.habitat}. The plotted value is the multinomial
  probability $\pi_{ij}$ for pixel $j$ under the model in Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}.
}
\label{rsf.fig.homeranges}
\end{figure}
The covariate in this case was simulated using a kriging
model 
%XXX RS: What's a kringing model? what does that mean for the covariate? is it a gradient, random, spatially autocorrelated?  XXXX
with the following {\bf R} commands:
\begin{verbatim}
> set.seed(1234)
> gr <- expand.grid(1:40,1:40)
> Dmat<-as.matrix(dist(gr))
> V <- exp(-Dmat/5)
> z <- t(chol(V))%*%rnorm(1600)
\end{verbatim}
Home ranges shown in Fig.~\ref{rsf.fig.homeranges} were simulated
with $\alpha_{1} =
1/(2\sigma^2)$, with $\sigma = 2$, and the coefficient on $C({\bf x})$
set to $\alpha_{2} = 1$. The resulting space usage densities -- ``home ranges'' -- exhibit clear
non-stationarity in response to the structure of the underlying
covariate, and they are distinctly asymmetrical.  We note that if
$\alpha_{2}$ were set to 0, the 8 home ranges shown here would
be proportional to bivariate normal kernels with $\sigma = 2$.
The commands for the kringing model, and those to produce Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.habitat} are in
the package \mbox{\tt scrbook} (see \mbox{\tt ?RSF$\_$example}).

  range centers for 8 individuals are shown with black dots.}
\label{rsf.fig.habitat}
\end{figure}
%XXX RS: I think I'd bring the habitat figure first, then the home ranges XXXX

\subsection{Poisson use model}
%XXRS: maybe Poisson model of space use XXX
A natural way to motivate the multinomial model of space usage is to
assume that individuals make a sequence of resource selection
decisions so that the outcomes $m_{ij}$ are {\it
  independent} Poisson random variables:
\[
 m_{ij} \sim \mbox{Poisson}( \lambda_{ij})
\]
where
\[
 \log(\lambda_{ij}) = a_{0} -\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2} +  \alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j})
\]
In this case, the number of visits to any particular cell is affected
by the covariate $C({\bf x})$ but has a baseline rate, $\exp(a_{0})$,
related to the amount (in an expected value sense) of movement occuring over some time interval.
This is an equivalent model to the multinomial model given previously
in the sense that, if we condition on the total sample size $R = 
\sum_{j} m_{ij}$, then the vector ${\bf m}_{i}$ has a multinomial
distribution with probabilities given by Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf} (see
also Chapt. \ref{chapt.poisson-mn}).  Also note that if use
frequencies are summarized over individuals for each pixel, i.e.,
create the totals $m_{.j} = \sum_i m_{ij}$, then a standard Poisson
regression model for the resulting ``quadrat counts'' is
reasonable. This is ``Design I'' in \citet{manly_etal:2002}.
%XXX maybe say what design I relates to - is it RSF specific or something else?
%%% Richard: can you embellish this a little bit?
% XX RS: Agree: Needs one or two sentences on design 1; also, before you cite Johnson and his levels of selection, then Manly's protocoll A, now design 1. Would be nice to reconcile all those. Maybe a table with the definitions? It just gets messy with 3 different scales/structures for the same problem XXXX

In practice, we never observe ``truth'', i.e., the actual use
frequencies $m_{ij}$. Instead, we observe a sampling XXX sample? XXX of the actual use
outcomes by an individual.  As formulated in
Sec.~\ref{scr0.sec.implied}, we assume a binomial (``random'')
sampling model:
\[
 y_{ij} \sim \mbox{Binomial}(m_{ij}, p_{0}).
\]
We can think of these counts as arising by thinning the underlying
point process (here, aggregated into pixels) where $p_{0}$ is the
thinning rate of the point process.  
% XXX RS: So far we've used point process to describe distribution of s in S. But now you mean the telemetry locations, right? Would make that more explicit XXXXX
In this case, the marginal
distribution of the observed counts $y_{ij}$ is also Poisson but with mean
\[
 \log(\mathbb{E}(y_{ij}))  = \log(p_{0}) + a_{0} -\alpha_{1} d_{ij}^{2} +  \alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}).
\]
Thus, the space-usage model (RSF) for the thinned counts $y_{ij}$ is
the same as the space-usage model for the original variables $m_{ij}$.
This is because if we remove $m_{ij}$ from the conditional model by
summing over its possible values, then the vector ${\bf y}_{i}$ is
{\it also} multinomial with cell probabilities
\[
\pi_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_{ij}}{\sum_{j} \lambda_{ij}}
\]
where any constant (the intercept term $a_0$ and thinning rate
$p_{0}$)
cancel 
from the numerator and denominator. Thus, the underlying multinomial
RSF model applies to the true unobserved count frequencies ${\bf
  m}_{i}$ and also those produced from thinning or sampling, ${\bf
  y}_{i}$.


\section{Integrating Capture-Recapture Data}

The key to combing RSF data with SCR data is 
to note that the Poisson model of space usage given above is 
exactly our Poisson encounter probability model from
Chapt. \ref{chapt.poisson-mn}, but with some arbitrary intercept off-set
related to the 
sampling rate by the telemetry device, and with
a spatial covariate  $C({\bf x})$.
We've used exactly this model for our SCR data (Chapt. \ref{chapt.covariates}), but with a different intercept,
$\alpha_{0}$, unrelated to the intercept of the Poisson use model
for telemetry described above but, rather, to the efficiency of the capture-recapture
encounter device. 
In other words, we view camera traps (or other devices) located in
some pixel ${\bf x}$ (or multiple pixels) as being equivalent to being able to turn on a
type of (less perfect) telemetry device only in that pixel.
%result of some thinning of the ``true'' space usage outcomes.
%In other words, imagine that we have a sampling device, such as a
%camera trap, in {\it every} pixel. If the device operates continually
%then it functions similar to a telemetry instrument in the sense that
%we can observe an individual in {\it any} pixel. But, given that 
%Given that real sampling devices
% operate imperfectly, intermittently, or do not expose the
%entire area of each pixel, then a reasonable model for this imperfect
%observation is the ``thinned'' binomial model given above, but with a
%different 
%intercept, say 
%representing the sampling
%effectiveness of the device, what we've called the baseline encounter
%rate in previous chapters. 
Therefore, 
data from a camera trapping are Poisson random variables 
for every pixel $j$ where a trap is located:
\[
y_{ij}|{\bf s}_{i} \sim \mbox{Poisson}( \lambda_{ij})
\]
with 
\[
 \log(\lambda_{ij}) =  \alpha_{0} -\alpha_{1}
 d_{ij}^{2} +  \alpha_{2} C({\bf x}_{j}).
\]
The parameters $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ are shared with the
multinomial model for the telemetry data.

Alternatively, 
the SCR study can produce binary 
encounters depending on the type of sampling being done,
where $y_{ij} = 1$ if the individual $i$ visited
the pixel containing a trap and was detected, then we imagine that
$y_{ij}$ is related to the latent variable $m_{ij}$ being the event
$m_{ij}>0$, which occurs with probability
\[
 p_{ij} = 1-\exp(- \lambda_{ij})
\]
%We combine the constants so that $\alpha_{0} = \log(\lambda_{0}) + a_{0}$
%is the baseline encounter rate which includes the constant intensity
%of use by the individual and also the baseline rate of detection,
%conditional on use.  The Bernoulli observation model implies that the
and then the observed encounter frequencies for individual $i$ and trap $j$, from
sampling over $K$ occassions are binomial:
\[
 y_{ij}|{\bf s}_{i} \sim \mbox{Binomial}(K, p_{ij}) 
\]

A key point here is that if resource selection is happening, then it
appears as a covariate on encounter rate (or encounter
probability) in the same way as ordinary covariates which were discussed in
Chapt. \ref{chapt.covariates}.


\subsection{The Joint RSF/SCR Likelihood}

To construct the likelihood for SCR data when we have 
direct information on space usage
from telemetry data, we regard the two samples (SCR and RSF) as
independent of one another, and we 
 form the likelihood for each set of observations as a function
of the same underlying parameters. The joint likelihood then is the
product of the two components. 

In particular, let ${\cal L}_{scr}(\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, N;{\bf y})$
be the likelihood for the SCR data in terms of the basic encounter
probability parameters and the total (unknown) population size $N$,
and let ${\cal L}_{rsf}(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}; {\bf m})$ be the
likelihood for the RSF data based on telemetry which, because the
sample size of telemetered individuals is fixed, does not depend on $N$.
Assuming independence of the two datasets, the
joint likelihood is the product of these two pieces:
\[
{\cal L}_{rsf+scr}(\alpha_{0},\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},N; {\bf y},{\bf
  m})  =
{\cal L}_{scr}(\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, N;{\bf y})
\times
{\cal L}_{rsf}(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}; {\bf m}),
\]
where the ${\cal L}_{scr}$ is the standard integrated likelihood
(Chapt. \ref{chapt.mle}), and the RSF likelihood contribution is the
multinomial telemetry likelihood having cell probabilities
Eq. \ref{rsf.eq.rsf}.  The {\bf R} code for this 
%XXX to maximize the joint likelihood? or for what? XXX 
was given in the
supplement to \citet{royle_etal:2012mee}, and we include a version of
this in the \mbox{\tt scrbook} package, see \mbox{\tt ?intlik3rsf},
which also shows how to simulate data and fit the combined SCR+RSF
model.

%XXX a lot of our book is from papers, but this section below sounds
%particularly like we didn't try.  I revised it a bit, hope you think it's okay

\section{SW  New York Black Bear Study}
\label{rsf.chapt.nybears}

\citet{royle_etal:2012mee} applied the integrated SCR+RSF model to
data from a study of black bears in a region of approximately 4,600
km$^2$ in southwestern New York \citep{sun:2013}\footnote{This is
different from our Fort Drum bear study data set which we've analyzed
in previous chapters}.  The data can be loaded from the \mbox{\tt scrbook}
library with the command \mbox{\tt data(nybears)}.
We reproduce the findings of \citet{royle_etal:2012mee} in this section.

The data are based on a noninvasive genetic capture-recapture study
using 103 hair snares in June and July, 2011.  Hair snares were baited
and scented and checked weekly for hair \citep{sun:2013}.  The study
yielded relatively sparse encounter histories
 of 33 individuals with a total of 14 recaptures (27
individuals captured 1 time only.
% Extra trap recaptures included  %XXX what is an extra trap recap?
%3 individuals captured in 2 traps, 1 individual in each of 3 and 4
%traps).  
Telemetry data were collected on 3 telemetry-collared individuals, which produced
locations for each bear approximately once per hour.  We 
thinned these data to once per 10 hours to produce movement outcomes that might
be more independent. This produced 195 telemetry locations used in the
RSF component of the model.  Elevation was used as the covariate for this 
model, a standardized version of which is shown in
Fig. \ref{fig.elevation} along with the locations of each
capture at hair snare sites.

%XXXX RS: I think this figure needs some work; symbols are difficult to distinguish. XXXX

There are a number of models that could be fitted to these data based on
the combination of SCR and RSF data as well as the elevation covariate.  
The models fit here are
 based on the Gaussian hazard trap encounter/space usage model,
including an ordinary SCR model with no covariates or telemetry data,
the SCR model with elevation affecting either $\lambda_{0}$ or density
$D({\bf x})$ (Chapt. \ref{chapt.state-space}), and models that use
telemetry data.  The 6 models fitted were:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Model 1,  SCR: ordinary SCR model
\item[] Model 2, SCR+p(C): ordinary SCR model with elevation as a
  covariate on baseline encounter probability $\lambda_{0}$.
\item[] Model 3, SCR+D(C): ordinary SCR model with elevation as a
  covariate on density only.
\item[] Model 4, SCR+p(C)+D(C): ordinary SCR model with elevation as
  a covariate on both baseline encounter probability and density.
\item[] Model 5, SCR+p(C)+RSF: SCR model including data from 3
  telemetered individuals.
\item[] Model 6, SCR+p(C)+RSF+D(C): SCR model including telemetered
  individuals and with elevation as a covariate on density.
\end{itemize}
It is tempting to want to compare these different models by AIC but,
because models 5 and 6 involve additional data, they cannot be
compared with models 1-4.  Parameter estimates for the six models are
given in Table \ref{tab.nyresults} (reproduced from
\citet{royle_etal:2012mee}, see also the help file \mbox{\tt
  ?nybears}).

By looking at Table \ref{tab.nyresults}, it is clear based on the
negative log likelihood for just Models 1-4, that those containing an
elevation effect on density are preferred (Model 3 and 4).  The
parameter estimates indicate a positive effect of elevation on
density, which seems to be consistent with the raw capture data shown
in Fig. \ref{fig.elevation}.  Despite this strong effect
of elevation, the estimates of $N$ under each of these models only
ranged from $93 - 103$ bears for the 4600 km$^2$ state-space.
%XXX RS: So density is pretty constant across models? XXX
  If we
consider not just density, but space usage (i.e., looking at the
parameter $\alpha_2$), the effect of elevation is negative.  Thus, elevation, appears to affect density and space usage
differently.  It was suggested that density operates at the
second-order scale of resource selection and ``....is largely related
to the spacing of individuals and their associated home ranges across
the landscape.  On the other hand, our RSF was defined based on
selection of resources within the home range (third-order).''
\citep{royle_etal:2012mee} 
%XXXX RS: Since you bring up second-order resource selection here, the different orders def. need to be defined earlier on XXX
The positive effect of density on elevation
is consistent with some other studies XXX on black bears? XXXX \citep[e.g.][]{frary_etal:2011},
and the negative effect of elevation on space usage can be attributed to
seasonal variation in food availability, usage of corridors, or
environmental conditions.


Models 5 and 6 include the additional telemetry data, thus the
negative log-likelihoods are not directly comparable to the first 4
models, but we can still make a few important observations.  First is
that the parameter estimates under these two models are consistent
with Model 4 in that elevation had a strong effect on both density and
space usage.  In comparing models 5 and 6, the latter model which
includes elevation as an effect on density reduces the negative
log-likelihood by 5 units.  Additionally, including the telemetry data
reduces the standard errors (SE) of the density and space usage
parameters and as we would expect, the incorporation of telemetry data
also reduces the SE for $\sigma$.  The increased precision for the
estimated population size ($N$) is negligible with the use of
telemetry data in this case.  However, that may be different if more
telemetry information were available.  Model 6 (SCR+p(C)+RSF+D(C)),
was used to produce maps of density (Fig. \ref{fig.density}) and space
usage (Fig. \ref{fig.spaceusage}) showing the effect of elevation on
both components of the model.  The map of space usage shows the
relative probability of using a pixel ${\bf x}$ relative to one having
the mean elevation, given a constant distance to the individual's
activity center.
 %XXXX is that a correct interpretation of what you did?

XXX Beth: I rewrote all of this above  
XXX you can put it all back in and take my stuff out if you want

{\bf XXXXXXXX below is exactly plagarized from the paper XXXXXXXXXXXX}
Looking at  models 1-4, which do not use the telemetry observations,
models in which elevation effects density are preferred, and we see a
a large positive response to elevation, which is apparent in
consistent with the visual pattern apparent in
Fig. \ref{fig.elevation} (more captures at higher elevations).
Conversely,
there is a negative effect of elevation on
space usage (the parameter $\alpha_{2}$).
The estimate of $N$ for the 4600 km$^2$ state-space, based on the best
model is about 103 bears $(\exp(4.25)+33)$.
In the two models that include the additional telemetry data, a couple
points stand out: Clearly the elevation effect on density is
important, reducing the negative log-likelihood by 5 units. The effect
of elevation on density and space usage are roughly consistent with
Model 4 which did not use telemetry data. Furthermore, the standard
errors (SE) of those two parameter estimates are reduced considerably
when the model uses telemetry data, as is the SE for estimating
$\log(\sigma)$.  The SE for estimating $\log(n_{0})$ is only improved
incrementally compared to the models without telemetry data.  We used
the best model, \mbox{\tt SCR+p(C)+RSF+D(C)}, to produce a map of
density (Fig. \ref{fig.density}) which shows clearly the pattern
induced by elevation. We also produced a map
(Fig. \ref{fig.spaceusage}) to illustrate the effect of elevation on
space usage. This shows the relative probability of using a pixel
${\bf x}$ relative to one of mean elevation, and of the same distance
from an individual's activity center.
% remind people how to compute "the relative prob of using pixel x XXXX
%The cool thing about these models is we can make pretty
%multi-colored maps of things.  A map of density under the
%model is shown in fig. \ref{fig.density}.  A map of space usage in
%terms of the relative probability of using pixel $x$ relative to the
%average pixel is shown in Fig. \ref{fig.spaceusage}.

\section{Simulation Study}

Using the simulated landscape shown in Fig. \ref{rsf.fig.habitat},
\citep{royle_etal:2012mee} presented results of a simulation study
considering populations of $N=100$ and $N=200$ individuals
%To
%simulate encounter data, a $7 \times 7$ array of trapping devices was
%located on the the integer coordinates $(u*5,v*5)$ for $u,v =
%1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ and sampling was conducted for $K=10$ periods.  For the
%XX RS: I would put the details back in; maybe not the integer coordinates, but the array and K for sure XXX
using the Gaussian hazard mode:
\[
\mbox{cloglog}(p_{ij}) = -2  -\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}} d_{ij}^{2} + 1 \times C({\bf x}_{j}).
\]
with $\sigma =2$.
Recall, that $\mbox{cloglog}(u) =
\log(-\log(1-u))$ is the complementary log-log function.
%XXX I reworded the above to make it clearer (it was kind of a long sentence before)
% Also, the cloglog is not previously used in this chapter so we might want
% to directly relate it to your equation in \section{Integrating Capture-Recapture Data}
In the absence of selection (omitting the covariate $C({\bf x})$),
this model corresponds to a space usage model that is bivariate normal
with standard deviation 2 (Sec. \ref{scr0.sec.implied}).

Using this model, \citet{royle_etal:2012mee} looked at the effect of
misspecification of the resource selection model with an ordinary
model SCR0 (i.e. no habitat covariates affecting the trap encounter model), and the peformance of the MLEs, under SCR+telemetry
designs having 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 telemetered individuals (with 20
independent telemetry fixes {\it per} individual). 
\citet{royle_etal:2012mee} fitted 3 models: (i) the SCR only model, in which the telemetry
data were not used; (ii) the integrated SCR/RSF model which combined
all of the data for jointly estimating model parameters; and (iii) the
RSF only model which just used the telemetry data alone (and therefore the parameters
$\alpha_{0}$ and $N$ are not estimable).  An abbreviated
version of the results from \citet{royle_etal:2012mee} is summarized
in Table \ref{rsf.tab.sims} below. We provide an {\bf R} script (see \mbox{\tt
  ?RSFsim}) that can be modified for further analysis and exploration.

One thing we see is a pretty dramatic XXX negative? positive? XXX bias in estimating $N$ if the
 model SCR0 is fitted (interestingly, there is much less bias in
estimating $\sigma$).  Overall, though, when either the SCR model with
covariate or the joint SCR+RSF model is fitted, the MLEs exhibit
little bias for the parameter values simulated here. In terms of RMSE,
there is only a slight $\approx$ 5\% reduction in RMSE of the
estimator of $N$ when we have at least 2 telemetered individuals, and
as much as a 10\% reduction as in the $N=200$ situations.
%XXX RS: Not really clear - so up to 5 percent with N=100, and up to 10 percent for N=200? XXXX
 This makes
sense because we nail down the parameters and still don't know where
guys are, and get info about mean $p$, i.e. $\alpha_{0}$, only from the
SCR data. 
%XXX RS: the previous sentence needs some rewording; it's unclear which parameters we nail and under what scenario XXX
Thus estimating $N$ benefits only slightly from the addition
of telemetry data.  However, there is a large improvement (50-60\%) XXX in precision? XXX in
estimating the home range parameter $\sigma$.  While this doesn't
translate much into improved estimation of $N$, it suggests that it
should be relevant to the design of SCR studies for which trap spacing
is one of the main considerations (Chapt. \ref{chapt.design}). In terms of study design these results also
suggest that, perhaps, spatial recaptures are not needed if some
telemetry data are available (in Chapt. \ref{chapt.partialID}, in the context of mark-resight models, we show a case study of raccoons where additional telemetry data allows estimating model parameters in spite of a very low number of spatial recaptures \citep{sollmann_etal:2012ecol}). The resource selection parameter
$\alpha_{2}$ is well-estimated even {\it without} telemetry data. The
fact that parameters of resrouce selection can be estimated from
ordinary capture-recapture data should have considerable practical
relevance in the study of animal populations and landscape
ecology. For the highest sample size of telemetered individuals
($n=16$), the RMSE for estimating this parameter only decreases from
about $0.09$ to $0.07$.

Results for $N=100$, $N=200$ and $N_{tel}=(2,4,8,12,16)$ are presented
in Table \ref{tab.results1}. We note that the first row of each batch
(labeled ``\mbox{\tt SCR only}'') represent the same estimator and data
configuration. These replicate runs of the SCR-only situation give us
an idea of the inherent Monte Carlo (MC) error in these simulations, which is
roughly about 0.25 and 0.89 on the $N$ scale for the $N=100$ and
$N=200$ cases, respectively.  The mean $N$ for the SCR-only
estimator across all 5 simulations for $N=100$ was
$\mbox{mean}(\hat{N}) = 99.418$, an empirical bias of $0.6\%$. For
$N=200$, the estimated $N$ across all 5 simulations (5 levels of
$N_{tel}$) was $\mbox{mean}(\hat{N}) = 199.712$, an empirical bias of
about $0.15\%$, within the Monte Carlo error of the true value of $N=200$.  The
results suggests a very small bias of $< 1\%$ in the MLE of $N$ for
both the  SCR-only and combined SCR/RSF estimators.  In practice, we
expect a small amount of bias in MLEs as likelihood theory only
guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness.


In terms of RMSE for estimating $N$, we see that (Table
\ref{tab.results1}), generally, there is about a 5\% reduction in RMSE
when we have at least 2 telemetered individuals. And, although there
is a lot of MC error in the RMSE quantities, it might be as much as a
10\% reduction as the sample size of captured individuals increases
under the higher $N=200$ setting. This incremental improvement in RMSE
of $\hat{N}$
makes sense because, while the
telemetry provides considerable information about the structural
parameters of the model, it provides no information about mean $p$,
i.e. $\alpha_{0}$, which comes only from the SCR data. Thus estimating
$N$ benefits only slightly from the addition of telemetry data.


The MLE of the RSF parameter $\alpha_{2}$ exhibits negligible or no
bias under {\it both} the SCR only and SCR/RSF estimators. It is
well-estimated from SCR data alone and even better than RSF data alone
(in terms of RMSE) until we have more than 200 or so telemetry
observations\footnote{This may appear pardoxical, but the SCR study is
  generating more spatial locations of individuals than the telemetry
  study based on 2 or 4 individuals}.  The biggest improvement from the use of telemetry data
comes in estimating the parameter $\sigma$. We see that $\hat{\sigma}$
is effectively unbiased, and there is a very large improvement in RMSE
of $\hat{\sigma}$, perhaps as much as 50-60\% in some cases, when the
telemetry data are used in the combined estimator (that does not
translate much into improvements in estimating $N$ as we saw
previously).  Improvement due to adding telemetry data diminishes as
the expected sample sizes increases, and so telemetry data does less
to improve the precision of $\hat{\sigma}$ and $\hat{\alpha}_{2}$ for
$N=200$ than for $N=100$. This is because the SCR data alone are
informative about both of those parameters.


The results as they concern likelihood estimation of $N$ suggest that
there is not a substantial benefit to having telemetry
data. Estimators ``SCR only'' and ``SCR/RSF'' both appear
approximately unbiased for $N=100$ and $N=200$, and for any sample
size of telemetered individuals. The RMSE is only 5-10\% improved with
the addition of telemetry information.  However, we find that there is
substantial bias in $\hat{N}$ if we use the {\it misspecified} model
that contains no resource selection component. That is, if we leave the
covariate $z({\bf x})$ out of the model and incorrectly fit a model
with a symmetric and spatially constant encounter model, we see about
20\% bias in the estimates of $N$ in our limited simulation study
(Table \ref{tab.bias}). As such, accounting for resource
selection is important, even though, when accounted for, telemetry
data only improves the estimator incrementally.
In addition, we find that the importance of telemetry data is
relatively more important for smaller sample sizes. We carried-out one
simulation study for the $N=100$ case, but with lower average encounter
probabilities, setting $\alpha_{0}=-3$. This produces
relatively smaller data sets with  $E[n] = 37$.
There are some important features evident from
the results depicted in Table \ref{tab.lowp}.
 First, as a result of the small samples, the MLE of $N$ is
biased for both SCR only and SCR/RSF estimators, although less biased
for the SCR/RSF estimator than for SCR only. The persistent bias in
$\hat{N}$ for both models results from the information about
$\alpha_{0}$ coming only from SCR data, and that estimator itself is
intrinsically biased in small samples.  Conversely, the estimator of
$\alpha_{2}$, the RSF parameter, appears unbiased for all 3 estimators
(SCR only, SCR/RSF and RSF only), as does the estimator of $\sigma$.
We see relatively larger improvements in RMSE (compared with Table
\ref{tab.results1}) of $\hat{N}$, and those improvements
increase substantially as $N_{tel}$ increases.

\section{Relevance and Relaxation of Assumptions}


In constructing the combined likelihood for RSF and SCR data, we
assumed the data from capture-recapture and telemetry studies were
independent of one another. This implies that whether or not an
individual enters into one of the data sets has no effect on whether
it enters into the other data set.  We cannot foresee situations in
which violation of this assumption should be problematic or invalidate
the estimator under the independence assumption.  In some cases it
might so happen that some individuals appear in {\it both} the RSF and
SCR data sets. In this case, ignoring that information should entail
only an incremental decrease in precision because a slight bit of
information about an individuals activity center is disregarded.
\begin{comment}
If
individuals that have telemetry instructments can also be encountered
in traps (and properly identified), then it would be possible to
modify the combined likelihood so that the individual activity centers
is preserved across both hunks of the likelihood.  In such cases where
we can match some individuals between the two samples, regarding them
as independent should only entail a minor loss of efficiency because
we are disregarding more precise information on a small number of
activity centers. Moreover, we believe, it is unlikely in practice to
expect the two samples to be completely reconcilable and that the
independence formulation is the most generally realistic.
\end{comment}

 Our model pretends that we do not know anything
about the telemetered individuals in terms of their encounter history
in traps. In principle it should not be difficult to admit a formal
reconciliation of individuals between the two lists. In that case, we
just combine the two conditional likelihoods before we integrate ${\bf
  s}$ from the conditional likelihood. This would be almost trivial to
do if {\it all} individuals were reconcilable (or none, as in the case
we have covered here). But, in general, we think you will often have
an intermediate case, i.e., either none will be or at most a subset
of telemetered guys will be known. More likely you have variations of ``well, that
individual looks telemetered but we are not sure which one it is....hmmm'' and
in that case, basically a type of marking uncertainty or
misclassification, is clearly more difficult to deal with although it is
possible that this can be dealt with in some cases (see
Chapt. \ref{chapt.partialID} for models that make use of marked,
unmarked, and unknown mark status of individuals).
%XXX RS: Well, not really... we say unknown makr status is an unsolved issue... XXX

We developed the model in a discrete landscape which regarded
potential trap
locations and the covariate $C({\bf x})$ as being defined on the same
set of points. In practice, trap locations may be chosen
independent of the definition of the raster and this does not pose any
challenge or novelty to the model as it stands. In that
case, the covariate(s) need to be defined at each trap location.
The model should be applicable also to covariates that are naturally
continuous (e.g., distance-based covariates) although, in pratice, it
will usually be sufficient to work with a discrete representation of
such covariates.

The multinomial RSF model for telemetry data assumes
independent observations of resource selection.  This would certaintly
be reasonable if telemetry fixes are made far apart in time (or thinned).
However, as noted by \citet{royle_etal:2012mee}, the independence assumption
is {\it not} an assumption of spatially independent movement outcomes
in geographic space.
Active resource selection should probably lead to the appearance of
spatially dependent outcomes,
 regardless of how far apart in time the telemetry
locations are.  Even if resource selection observations are dependent,
use of the independence model probably yields unbiased estimators while under-stating the variance.
Development of integrated SCR+RSF models that
accommodate more general models of movement is needed.




\section{Summary and Outlook}


How animals use space is of fundamental interest to ecologists and is
important in the conservation and management of many species. Investigating space use is normally done using telemetry and models referred to as resource
selection functions \citep{manly_etal:2002} but in all of human   %very dramatic here!
history, animal resource selection has {\it never} been studied using
capture-recapture models. Instead, essentially all applications of SCR
models have focused on density estimation.  It is intuitive, however,
that space usage should affect encounter probability and thus it
should be highly relevant to density estimation in SCR
applications, and, vice versa, SCR applications should yield data relevant to resource selection questions. The development in this chapter shows clearly that these
two ideas can be unified within the SCR methodological framework so
that classical notions of resource selection modeling can be
addresssed simultaneous to modeling of animal density. What we find is
that if animal resource selection is occurring, this can be modeled as
covariate on encounter probability, with or without the availability
of auxiliary telemetry data. If telemetry data do exist, we can
estimate parameters jointly by cominbing the two likelihood components
-- that of the SCR data and that of the telemetry data.

%%% one idea is to use these models to account for sampling along
%%% trails.
%%% define z(x) = trail density or average distance to trail

Active resource selection by individuals
induces a type of heterogeneous encounter probability, and this
induces (possibly severe) bias in the estimated population size for a
state-space when default symmetric
encounter probability models are used.
As such, it is important to account for space usage when relevant
covariates are known to influence space use patterns.
Aside from properly modeling this selection-induced heterogeneity, integration of RSF data from telemetry with SCR models achieves a
number of useful advances:
First, it
leads to an improvement in our ability to estimate density,
and also an improvement in our ability to estimate parameters of the
RSF function.  As many animal population studies have auxiliary
telemetry information, the incorporation of such information
into SCR studies has broad applicability to many studies.  It seems
possible even to estimate density now, with no spatial recaptures,
provided telemetry data are available.
Secondly,
the integrated model
allows for the estimation of RSF model parameters directly from SCR
data {\it alone}.  This establishes clearly that SCR models {\it are}
explicit models of space usage. In our view, this greatly broadens the
utility and importance of capture-recapture studies beyond their
primary historical use of estimating density or population
size. Finally, we note that telemetry information provide direct
information about the home range shape parameter, $\sigma$ in our
analyses above, 
and its
estimation is 
greatly improved with even moderate amounts of telemetry data (see
also \citet{sollmann_etal:2012ecol} and \citet{sollmann_etal:inprepjapplecol}.
This should have some consequences in terms of the design of capture-recapture
studies (Chapt. \ref{chapt.design}), especially as it relates to trap spacing.

Simultaneously conductingt telemetry studies with capture-recapture
is extremely common in field studies of animal populations. However,
the simultaneous, integrated analysis of the two sources of data has
not been done.  The new class of integrated SCR/RSF models based on
the \citet{royle_etal:2012mee} model allows researchers to model how
the landscape and habitat influence the movement and space use of
individuals around their home range, using non-invasively collected
capture-recapture data that can be augmented with
telemetry data.  This should improve our ability to understand, and
study, aspects of space usage and it might, ultimately, aid in
addressing conservation-related problems such as reserve or corridor
design. This development should greatly expand the relevance and utility of
spatial capture-recapture beyond its use for density
estimation.
