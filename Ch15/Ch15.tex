So far, this book has dealt with the situation where all detected
individuals are identifiable, and in Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}
we introduced and developed an SCR model for non-identifiable
populations, a spatial {\it non}-capture-recapture model, if you will. These
two extremes are common in the study of animal populations with
non-invasive sampling methods. However, there is also an intermediate
situation, where a part of the population is tagged or otherwise
marked and can thus be identified upon recapture, while the untagged
portion remains unidentified. In this situation so-called mark-resight
models \citep{bartmann_etal:1987, arnason_etal:1991, neal_etal:1993}
can be used to estimate population size and density combining data
from both the marked and unmarked individuals.

Traditionally, capture-recapture studies involved physical capture of
individuals throughout the study; new individuals are marked on every
re-capture occasion. This methodology is still widely applied to small
mammals, but can be very costly, logistically challenging and risky
when dealing with larger species. In contrast, in mark-resight studies
a sample of individuals is captured and tagged (or otherwise marked)
during a single marking event. Marking is followed by resighting
surveys, upon which both the detection of marked and recognizable
individuals and unmarked animals is recorded. Resighting surveys are
usually non-invasive (hence the name ‘resighting’), so that they
don't involve handling of animals. As such, mark-resight models have a
major advantage over traditional capture-recapture models in that they
only require individuals to be captured and handled once, during the
initial marking. This reduces field costs and risks for the animals
(and potentially the researchers).

Mark-resight models have a set of underlying assumptions, most of
which are analogous to those for mark-recapture models,
e.g. demographic population closure (violation of geographic
population closure can be accommodated by some models) and no loss or
misidentification of marks. Just like regular capture-recapture
models, there are means to incorporate heterogeneity in capture
probability. However, a new and essential assumption of mark-resight
models is that the tagged (or otherwise identifiable) individuals are
a representative sample of the study population, so that inference
about individual detection can be made for the whole population from
the tagged sample. This issue is usually addressed by using a
different method for marking than for resighting, and by marking a
random sample of the population.

Owing to the advantages of mark-resight over capture-recapture,
especially when dealing with hard-to-trap species, mark-resight is a
popular tool in wildlife population studies. The method has been
applied for decades and to a suite of species and survey techniques,
ranging from banding and resighting Canada geese
\citep{hestbeck_malecki:1989} to ear-tagging and camera-trapping
grizzly bears \citep{mace_etal:1994} to paintball marking and areal
resightings of large ungulates \citep{skalski_etal:2005}.

\subsection{Types of partial ID data}

Before we start exploring mark-resight approaches in more detail, we
need a clear understanding of what types of mark-resight data we can
have, in order to appreciate and understand the different flavors of
mark-resigh models.  In general, we have (at least) two sets of data:
encounter histories for identifiable individuals $i$ at trap $j$ and
occasion $k$, $y_{ijk}$, and counts of unidentified records for each
$j$ and $k$, $n_{jk}$. Depending on the sampling technique, we can
conceive of three slightly different types of partial ID data.



If you implement your resighting survey shortly after the marking
session, you may be confident that none of the marked individuals has
died or lost its mark. Under these circumstances you know that the
number of marked individuals available for resighting, $m$, is equal
to the number of individuals you tagged. Alternatively, tags might be
radio-transmitters, allowing you to confirm the presence or absence of
marked individuals in the resighting survey area using radio-telemetry
\citep{white_shenk:2001}. In both cases, you know the number of marked
individuals in the population you survey.

In this situation, even though you may fail to resight some of the
tagged individuals, since you know how many there are, you can simply
assign those you never resighted all-zero capture histories - in other
words, contrary to regular capture-recapture models, in mark-resight
models with a known number of tagged individuals, we can observe
all-zero encounter histories. Under these circumstances, estimating
$N$ reduces to estimating the number of unmarked individuals, $U$.

If we suspect that some of the marks may have been lost between
tagging and conducting the resighting samples, we obtain a slightly
different type of mark-resight data. Here, we do not know the accurate
number of marked individuals available for resighting. As a
consequence, individuals have to be resighted at least once for us to
know they are still tagged and alive and thus available for
resighting. So, contrary to the situation where we know $m$ and
analogous to regular capture-recapture models, we cannot observe
all-zero encounter histories of marked individual. Here, estimating
$N$ involves both estimating $m$ and $U$.

A special case of this kind of data can arise from camera
trapping. Even when dealing with a species that has no spots or
stripes, some individuals in the study population can have natural
marks that make them identifiable on pictures, such as scars or some
distinct coloration. Again, in this scenario an individual has to be
photographed at least once to be known. Here, the fact that both the
`marking’ method and the subsequent resighting method are the same
(although marking in this case does not involve any actual physical
marking) can be cause for concern: our sample of `marked’
individuals may not be a random sample of the population but consist
of individuals that for some reason are more likely to be
photographed. In that case, a basic assumption of the mark-resight
model is violated.

Finally, consider a scat or hair snare survey, where only a part of
the samples are analyzed genetically (or DNA can only be extracted
from a subset of samples due to sample quality). In this scenario,
your $n_{jk}$ can contain both completely unknown individuals that are
not represented at all in {\bf $Y$}, but it can also contain samples
from individuals that we previously identified. The difference is that
in the first two scenarios, part of the population of individuals is
identifiable, while in the second scenario, part of the
samples is identifiable. This type of data
actually violates one of the basic assumptions of mark-resight models,
namely, that tagged individuals are always correctly identified as
such. To our knowledge there are currently no mark-resight models
available that account for possible misidentification of the marking status of individuals (although there some literature is available on misidentification of individuals in capture-recapture study, e.g., \citealp{yoshizaki_etal:2009, lukacs_burnham:2005, link_etal:2010}). In this chapter we will ignore this kind of data and focus instead
on the two types of typical mark-resight data:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Known number of tagged individuals 
\item[(2)] Unknown number of tagged individuals, 
\end{itemize}

For both types of data a slightly different situation arises when in some instances we can only tell that an individual is tagged, but not who it is. You may be able to see that an individual is tagged but the identifying feature of the tag (a number or coloration) may have become unreadable, or may be hidden from view. In this case, in addition to your $y_{ijk}$ and your $n_{jk}$ you also have a number of sightings of tagged but unidentified individuals, say $r_{jk}$. 

\subsection{A short history of mark-resight models}

Initially, mark-resight methods focused on radio-tagged individuals to
estimate population size \citep{white_shenk:2001}. Radio-collars
provide a means of determining which of the animals were in the study
area and available for sampling, i.e. determining the number of marked
individuals in the population. Knowing this number was a prerequisite
for most earlier mark-resight approaches \citep{white:1996}. The
oldest mark-resight model is the good old Lincoln-Petersen estimator,
 where individuals are marked and a single resight/recapture occasion is carried out \citep{krebs:1999}. We need not identify individuals, but only tell apart marked from unmarked individuals. Let $m$ be the number of marked individuals in the population, $m_{(R)}$ the number of marked individuals seen on the resighting occasion, and $n_{(R)}$ the total number of marked and unmarked individuals observed during resighting. Abundance $N$ is then estimated as 
\[
N = m \times n_{(R)}/m_{(R)}
\]

A suite of more elaborate models using individual capture histories
over several resighting occasions were developed in the 1980ies and
90ies and compiled into the program NOREMARK \citep{white:1996}. Apart
from the basic model with known number of marked individuals and no
individual variation in resighting probabilities (joint hypergeometric
maximum likelihood estimator) \citep{bartmann_etal:1987,
  white_garrot:1990, neal:1990, neal_etal:1993}, NOREMARK contains
models that account for lack of geographical population closure
\citep{neal_etal:1993}, individual heterogenenity in resighting rates
and sampling with replacement (i.e. individuals can be seen more than
once on any occasion, \citep{minta_mangel:1989, bowden:1993}). A first
mark-resight model allowing for an unknown number of marked
individuals was developed by \citet{arnason_etal:1991}.

While many of these models perform well under certain situations, they
are somewhat limited: they do not allow for combining data across
several surveys \citep{mcclintock_etal:2006} and not all of them are
likelihood-based or allow for different parameterization, so that
selection of the most appropriate model cannot be based on standard
approaches such as AIC, but is largely left up to educated guesswork
\citep{mcclintock_etal:2006}. Recently, more flexible and generalized
likelihood-based mark-resight models have been developed. These models
can account for individual heterogeneity in detection, unknown number
of marked individuals and lack of geographical closure, as well as a
less than 100\% individual identification rate of tagged individuals;
they can be applied to sampling with and without replacement and can
combine data across several primary sampling occasions in a robust
design type of analysis
\citep{mcclintock_etal:2009biometrics,mcclintock_etal:2009mdp}. Since
they are all likelihood-based, model selection among different
parameterizations and model averaging based on AIC is an option. Most
of these models have also been incorporated into the program MARK
\citep{mcclintock_white:2010}.

For a detailed treatment of these different non-spatial mark-resight
models, we refer you to the original papers cited in the preceeding
paragraph. In short, these models are based on the joint likelihood of
two major model components: one describing the resighting process of
marked individuals (either using a Poisson or a Bernoulli observation
model, depending on whether sampling is with or without replacement),
where resighting probabilities can have both fixed effects to model
individual and environmental covariates, and a random-effect component
to accommodate variation in detection due to individual heterogeneity;
and one describing the total observations of unmarked individuals,
$n_t$ which are approximated as a normal distribution
\citep{mcclintock_etal:2006}, or a normal distribution left-truncated
at 0 \citep{mcclintock_etal:2009biometrics}:
\[
n_t \sim Normal (E(n_t), V(n_t))
\]
Although this is a simplification of the actual sampling process, \citet{mcclintock_etal:2006} found this Normal distribution to be a satisfactory approximation, which allows $N$ to enter the model likelihood via $E(n_t)$ and $V(n_t)$.

In the simplest model case without any variation in detection, the
expected number of resightings of unmarked individuals, $E(n_t)$, can
be written as the number of unmarked individuals times the expected number of detections of a single individual, which is the mean or expected value of the underlying observation model:
\begin{equation}
E(n_t) = (N-m) * \theta 
\end{equation}
\label{partialID.eq.E_n}
where $\theta = k \times p$ for a Binomial observation model with $k$
replicates and individual detection probability $p$, or $\theta$ =
expected/average individual encounter rate $\lambda$ for a Poisson
observation model. Similarly, $V(n_t)$ depends on the underlying
observation model and is based on the parameters
that determine the individual detection probability/encounter
rate. Combining these two components, $N$ is directly incorporated
into the joint likelihood of the model.

While these mark-resight models are very flexible, they
share the shortcomings of “regular” capture-recapture models
when it comes to estimating population density (e.g., Chapts. \ref{chapt.intro, chapt.closed}). 
In the following sections we will consider mark-resight sampling in the framework of spatial capture-recapture. We will look at models for both known and unknown numbers of marked individuals, and for imperfect individual identification of marks. In the spatial framework, most of the information on model parameters comes from the marked individuals. But in Sect. \ref{partialID.sec.info} we will see that, analogous to the models we developed in the previous Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}, the spatial correlation in counts of unmarked individuals also contributes information about detection and movement. 

\section{Known number of marked individuals}

Let's begin with the easiest data situation: a known number of
individuals constituting a random, representative sample from the
population are marked and a series of resight samples are conducted
following marking. No marks (or marked animals) are lost between
marking and resighting, all individuals are correctly identified as
marked or unmarked, and marked individuals are 100 \% correctly
identified to individual level.

Recall that without individual identity, the observed counts at trap
$j$ and occasion $k$, $n_{jk}$, represent the sum of all latent
individual detections at $j$ and $k$,
$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} y_{ijk}$, where $y_{ijk}$ are the
latent individual encounter histories. We can model these counts as
\[
n_{jk} \sim \mbox{Poisson}( \Lambda_{j} )
\]
Under this formulation we do not need to update the individual
$y_{ijk}$ in our model, which  is more efficient in terms of
computing. However, we can also formulate the model as conditional on
the latent $y_{ijk}$. This is useful because if we have $m$
individually known animals in our study population, than those $m$
$y_{ijk}$ are no longer latent, but fully observed and can easily be
included in the analysis. 

The formulation conditional on $y_{ijk}$ basically brings us back to the original SCR model, where individual site and occasion specific counts, $y_{ijk}$, are modeled as
\[
y_{ijk} \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\lambda _{ij})
\] 
and
\[
\lambda _{ij} = \lambda_0 * exp(-D_{ij}^2/(2 \sigma^2))
\]
XXXX You use $D_{ij}$ and maybe Richard does too. I haven't
been..... maybe we should standardize on $D_{ij}$? XXXXX


Unobserved $y_{ijk}$ are essentially missing data and have to be
updated as part of the MCMC procedure. We can do that by using their
full conditional distribution, which is multinomial with sample size
$n_{jk}$:
\[
y_{ujk} \sim Multinomial (n_{jk}, \lambda_{uj})
\]
where \textbf{\emph{u}} is an index vector of the $M-m$ hypothetical unmarked individuals.

  
While in the non-spatial mark-resight analysis known individuals
provide direct information about individual detection probability (or
rate), in the spatial setting they also inform the movement parameter
$\sigma$. Including known individuals into the analysis helps estimate
model parameters more accurately and precisely. We will address the
relationship between the number of marked individuals and accuracy of
the estimated parameters in section \ref{partialID.sec.info}.

\subsection{MCMC for a spatial mark-resight model}


Just as for the model without individual identification, for the
partial ID model, knowing how to write your own MCMC algorithm comes
in extremely handy. You will find that we only have to make relatively
simple modifications to the MCMC code for the model without any
individual identification presented in
Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}, which, in turn, has much in common
with the algorithms we developed for regular SCR models in
Chapt. \ref{chapt.mcmc}.
Essentially, since we observe individual detections for the marked part of the population, we have to update only the unobserved part of ${\bf Y}$, and
modify the updating steps for $z_i$ and $\psi$ to reflect some
contribution to our
knowledge of these parameters from the $m$ tagged individuals.

First, we set up an array to hold ${\bf Y}$, fill the first $m$ rows
of the array with the $m$ observed individual encounter histories,
then update ${\bf Y}$ for the unknown individuals only (note that the
code is set up so that $n_{jk}$ contains both pictures of marked {\bf
  and} unmarked individuals at $j$ and $k$):

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
# set up placeholders and create vectors for marked and unmarked    
 Y <- array(NA, c(M, J, K))
    nMarked <- nrow(y)
    marked <- rep(FALSE, M)
        marked[1:nMarked] <- TRUE
        Y[1:nMarked, , ] <- y
    z[marked] <- 1
    Ydata <- !is.na(Y)
    for (j in 1:J) {
        for (k in 1:K) {
            if (y[j, k] == 0) {
                Y[, j, k] <- 0
                next
            }
            unmarked <- !Ydata[, j, k]
            nUnknown <- n[j, k] - sum(Y[!unmarked, j,k])
            if (nUnknown < 0) 
                browser()
            probs <- lam[, j] * z
            probs <- probs[unmarked]
            probs <- probs/sum(probs)
            Y[unmarked, j, k] <- rmultinom(1, nUnknown, probs)
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}
}

When we know the number of marked individuals in the population estimating $N$ is reduced to etimating $u$. Thus, we only need to estimate the $z_i$ for $M-m$ unknown individuals. Thus, the updater for $z_i$ becomes:

\begin{verbatim}
zUps <- 0
seen <- apply(Y > 0, 1, any)
   for (i in 1:M) {
       if (seen[i] | marked[i]) 
                next
       zcand <- ifelse(z[i] == 0, 1, 0)
       ll <- sum(dpois(Y[i, , ], lam[i, ] * z[i], log = TRUE))
       llcand <- sum(dpois(Y[i, , ], lam[i, ] * zcand, 
                  log = TRUE))
       prior <- dbinom(z[i], 1, psi, log = TRUE)
       prior.cand <- dbinom(zcand, 1, psi, log = TRUE)
          if (runif(1) < exp((llcand + prior.cand) - (ll + 
                prior))) {
          z[i] <- zcand
          zUps <- zUps + 1
            }
        }
\end{verbatim}

Observe that while we skip the update of $z_i$ for the ‘seen’ individuals, seen is defined based on ${\bf Y}$ and ${\bf Y}$ is updated at each iteration, so the $z_i$ for the ‘seen’ but unmarked individuals are effectively still updated.

Finally, our update for $\psi$ needs to reflect that we are effectively only estimating $U$. In the full conditional beta distribution we have to replace $M$ with $M-m$ and $\sum z$ with $\sum z -m$:

\begin{verbatim}
  psi<-rbeta(1,1+sum(w[!marked]),1+sum(!marked)-sum(w[!marked]))   
\end{verbatim}

The remainder of the code is essentially identical to the MCMC code for regular SCR models we developed in Chapt. \ref{chapt.mcmc}.
You can find the full MCMC code (including the modeling options we'll discuss in the upcoming sections) in the accompanying {\bf R} package {\tt scrbook} by invoking {\tt scrPID()}. 

\subsection{Binomial encounter model}
So far, we have only worked with Poisson encounter models for partially identifiable or unmarked populations. When we use a Bernoulli model instead, we have to make some changes to how we update the latent $y_{ijk}$, to ensure that a hypothetical individual receives at most a single observation at a given trap and occasion from the pool of $n_{jk}$ pictures. Effectively, we move from a multinomial situation where the same individual could be drawn repeatedly, to a sampling without replacement situation (an individual drawn once at $j$ and $k$ cannot be drawn again); here is how we implement this in our MCMC algorithm:

\begin{verbatim}
 Y <- array(NA, c(M, J, K))
#[...]
    for (j in 1:J) {
        for (k in 1:K) {
            if (y[j, k] == 0) {
                Y[, j, k] <- 0
                next
            }
            unmarked <- !Ydata[, j, k]
            nUnknown <- n[j, k] - sum(Y[!unmarked, j,k])
            if (nUnknown < 0) 
                browser()
            probs <- lam[, j] * z
            probs <- probs[unmarked]
            probs <- probs/sum(probs)
            Y[unmarked, j, k] <- 0
            guys <- sample(which(unmarked), nUnknown, 
			prob = probs)
            Y[guys, j, k] <- 1
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}


{\flushleft \bf Example: Canada geese in North Carolina } 
We applied the spatial mark-resight model with a Bernoulli encounter process to a dataset of of Canada goose resightings \citep{rutledge:2012} XXXget citation with LizXXX. During the molt of 2008, 751 individual geese were captured and tagged with neck and leg bands in Greensboro, North Carolina. Geese were resighted at 87 different locations on 81 resighting events over a period of 18 months. In addition to the banded geese, the number of unmarked geese was recorded during each resighting event. Here, we only looked at a subset of the data, from mid July to the end of October 2008, which corresponds to the first part of the post-molt season, before migratory Canada geese arrive in North Carolina.  
During this time frame, 746 of the 751 marked geese were known to be alive. Of those, 654 were resighted 3994 times at 40 different sites. In addition, 7944 sightings of unmarked geese were recorded at 48 sites. 

In this model, we also allowed $\sigma$ to vary between males and females. We augmented the data set with 4500 - $m$ all-zero encounter histories, ran 50000 MCMC iterations and removed a burn-in of 1000 iterations. We provide all the data (data(canadageese)) and functions for you to repeat this analysis but be aware that given the large data set it will take days to do so. The model results, including the derived parameter density ($D$) in individuals per $km^2$ are shown below.

\end{verbatim}

We see that credible intervals of estimates are pretty tight. Take, for example, $\sigma$ for males and females: Although they differ only by 0.08, there is barely any overlap between the respective credible intervals, surely an effect of the large data set. Phi in this model is the probability of being a male, or the sex ratio of the populations in terms of males:females, which is close to 1:1.      


\section {Unknown number of marked individuals}

Now let us consider the case where we do not know the exact number of tagged individuals available for resighting so that we have to capture an individual at least once to be sure that it is available. Unless we have a direct means of confirming the number of marked animals available for resighting, treating this number as unmarked is probably more realistic in most circumstances. As a consequence of not knowing the exact number of marked individuals, we cannot observe all-zero encounter histories. When using maximum likelihood inference, this situation requires a model where detection rates of known individuals are modeled using a zero-truncated distribution \citep{mcclintock_etal:2009biometrics}. If we did not account for the fact that 0’s are unobservable, our estimates of detection rates would be artificially inflated and estimates of population size would be negatively biased. 

Working with zero-truncated distributions in a spatial mark-resight setting is less straight-forward than for non-spatial mark-resight. A marked individual only has to show up once, anywhere on the sampling grid, for us to know that it is there. When resightings are pooled across the entire sampling grid,then the total individual counts $\sum_j y_{ij}$ have to be $>$ 0 for all resighted individuals and a zero-truncated distribution can be used to model these counts. However, we are concerned with trap-specific encounters, $y_{ij}$, which can easily be 0 for a resighted individual, as long as a single $y_{ij}$ is $>$ 0. Thus, the zero-truncation does not apply to the individual and trap specific counts we observe, but only to the sum of these counts over all traps. 

As an alternative to a zero-truncated distribution, in a Bayesian framework, we can make use of data augmentation to estimate the number of marked individuals\footnote{For the interested reader, \citet{mcclintock_hoeting:2010} implement a non-spatial mark-resight model with a binomial observation model in a Bayesian framework using data augmentation}. 
In the previous example, where we knew the number of marked individuals, we essentially removed those individuals from the augmented population by fixing their $z_i$ at 1 and letting $\psi$ refer only to the unmarked population, $M-m$. All we have to do in the spatial mark-resight model with unknown number of marked individuals is to let our marked individuals be part of the augmented population again, analogous to the situation in regular SCR models:
\begin{verbatim}
        psi <- rbeta(1, 1 + sum(z), 1 + M - sum(z))
\end{verbatim}
Whether you have a known or an unknown number of marked individuals is included as an option in {\tt scrPID}.

\section  {Individual identification rate of tagged animals $<$ 100 \%}
Often during resighting, it may be possible to see that an individual is tagged but impossible to determine the individual identity of the tag. In such a situation in addition to the $y_{ijk}$ and $n_{jk}$, we also have site and occasion specific counts of marked but unidentified individuals, $r_{jk}$. Here, the individual encounter histories of marked animals are essentially incomplete, and if we used these incomplete data to inform the detection parameter of the model, we would be likely to underestimate detection/trap encounter rate and overestimate abundance. Some non-spatial mark-resigh models do not require that marked animals be identified individually, as long as the marking status can be observed unambiguously, but ignoring individual level information means that we cannot accomodate heterogeneity in detection \citet{mcclintock_white:2010}. In a spatial framework we could ignore marked and unmarked status completely and apply the model by \citet{chandler_royle:2012} we discussed in Chapt. \ref{chapt.scr-unmarked}. But again, that would mean losing important information on individual detection and movement. Therefore, being able to retain the individual identity of records that can be identified while at the same time accounting for an identification rate $<$ 100 \% is extremely useful. 
\citet{mcclintock_etal:2009biometrics,mcclintock_etal:2009mdp} suggest an intuitive means of correcting for this bias in a non-spatial model framework when dealing with a Poisson encounter model (or sampling with replacement). When marked but unknown resightings are part of the data, the expected number of records of unmarked individuals at time $t$, $n_t$, changes from Eq. \ref{partialID.eq.E_n} to:

\[
E(n) = (N-m) { \lambda  + \eta/m}
\]
Here, $\lambda$ is the individual encounter rate estimated from the known resighted individuals and $\eta$ is the number of records of marked but unidentified individuals. So essentially, because observed $\lambda$ is known to be too low, the average number of unidentified pictures per known individual is added as a correction factor. This procedure assumes that the inability to identify a marked individual occurs at random throughout the population, which seems to be a reasonable assumption under most circumstances.

We can relatively easily translate this concept to our spatial mark-resight models. In the spatial model framework we are interested in the individual and trap specific encounter rate, $\lambda_{ij}$. Further, we do not look at the sum of all records of unmarked individuals, but formulate the model conditional on the latent individual encounter histories. Thus, instead of using $\eta/m$ as a correction factor, we need something that applies at the individual and trap level. If we take the sum of all correctly identified records of marked individuals, $\sum y_c$ and divide it by the total number of records of marked individuals, $\sum y_m$, we get the average rate of correct individual identification for marked individuals, say, $c$:
\[
c = \sum y_c/\sum y_m
\]

For the marked individuals we can then multiply $\lambda_0$ with $c$ to account for the fact that we observe incomplete individual encounter histories. For example, if on average we are able to assign 80\% of the records of marked animals to the correct individual, we would multiply $\lambda_0 \times 0.8$ for the marked individuals. Since we don't have this identification issue for unmarked individuals, their baseline trap encounter rate remains as before simply $\lambda_0$ (or in other words, their $c$ equals 1). Observe that now, in addition to assuming that failure to identify tagged individuals occurs at random throughout the population, we also assume that it occurs at random throughout space, i.e. our success of identifying a tagged individual does not depend on the trap we encounter it in. 
It is straightforward to  include this correction factor in our MCMC algorithm, by simply specifying a vector of length $M$, where $c = 1$ for all unmarked (hypothetical) individuals and $c = \sum y_c/\sum y_m$ for all marked individuals. Incomplete individual identification of marked individuals is included as an option in the {\tt scrPID} function.

XXXX maybe we can include the ISSJ as an example, but estimates of N will be huuuge XXX

As long as individuals are identified based on the same type of tags the assumption that failure to identify marked individuals occurs at random throughout the population should be valid. The assumption that failure to identify marked individuals occurs at random in space could be violated, for example when spatially varying habitat conditions influence the ability to recognize individual tags. Also, observer effects could influence individual identification rates. While we haven't ourselves experimented with it, we belive that the above described approach could readily be extended to account for these differences. For example, identification rates could be calculated separately for different observers, or be modeled as functions of habitat covariates. 


\section{How much information do marked and unmarked individuals contribute?}
\label{partialID.sec.info}
It is intuitive that having marked individuals in the study population should lead to more accurate and precise parameter estimates than when no individuals are identifiable. To evaluate how strongly adding marked individuals to a population improves parameter esimtates, \citet{chandler_royle:2012} performed a simulation study. They used a 15 × 15 trap grid and
simulated detection data of $N = 75$ individuals in a 20 x 20 units state-space over $k = 5$ occasions with
$\sigma = 0.5$ and $\lambda_0 = 0.5$. They generated 100 datasets each for
$m$ = (0, 5, 15, 25, 35) where $m$ is the number of marked individuals randomly sampled from the population and is assumed to be known.

Without any marked individuals in the population, the posterior distribution of $N$ turned out to be fairly skewed, but its mode was still an approximately unbiased point estimator of $N$. As anticipated, posterior precision increased substantially with the proportion of marked individuals (Tab. \ref{partialID.tab.sim} and Fig. \ref{partialID.fig.nposts}). The posterior mode was approximately unbiased as a point estimator, and the relative root-mean squared error decreased from 0.246 when no individuals were marked to 0.085 when 35 individuals were marked (Tab. \ref{partialID.tab.sim}). Coverage was nominal for all values of $m$ and posterior skew greatly diminished with increasing $m$(Tab. \ref{partialID.tab.sim}).

As we saw in the previous chapter, the spatial correlation in unmarked counts can be sufficient to obtain estimates of movement and detection parameters. However, only marked and thus identifiable individuals provide us with direct information about these parameters and may well dominate estimates. 
To single out the contribution of marked and unmarked individuals to parameter estimates, we re-ran the same simulations but let $\sigma$ and $\lambda_0$ be updated based solely on the data of marked individuals. Results are summarized in Tab. \ref{partialID.tab.sim2}.
We see that if we update $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$ based on marked individuals only, estimates of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$ are more biased and less precise. For estimates of $N$, especially for $m$= 5 and $m$ = 15, we observe a stronger positive bias, lower accuracy and considerably lower BCI coverage as compared to when both marked and unmarked individuals contribute to parameter estimates (Tab. \ref{partialID.tab.sim2}). Thus, unmarked individuals do actually contribute noticeably to estimating model parameters.

\section{Integrating telemetry data}
As we expected, parameter estimates of spatial mark-resight models get better the more marked individuals we have in our study population. While this is great advice in theory, it may not be very helpful in practise, especially when dealing with animals that are hard or somewhat dangerous to capture, such as large carnivores. Oftentimes, studies involving the physical capture of such animals will employ telemetry tags in order to learn about the study species' spatial ecology and behavior. In the context of spatial mark-resight models, the actual locational data collected by telemetry tags can provide detailed information on individual location and movement, and being able to incorporate this information directly into the SMR model should improve estimates of these parameters, especially when resighting information is sparse.

So how could we combine resighting data and telemetry data in a unified mark-resight model? Recall that the basic SCR model underlying all the SMR models we discuss here uses a half-normal detection function.
By using this function, we can relate the parameters $\sigma$ and ${\bf s}_{i}$ directly to those from a bivariate normal movement model, with mean = ${\bf s}_{i}$, and variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$, where the variance in both dimensions is $\sigma^2$ and the covariance is 0. Ordinarily, these parameters are estimated directly from the spatial distribution of individual recaptures/resightings. Telemetry data, however, provide more detailed information on individual location and movement, since the resolution and extent of the data are not limited by the trapping grid and potentially more locations can be accumulated through telemetry than resighting (depending on the monitoring frequency and resighting rates of individuals).  

By assuming that the locations of individual $i$, ${\bf l}_{i}$ (consisting of a pari of x and y coordinates, $l_{ix}$ and $l_{iy}$), are a bivariate normal random variable:
\[
{\bf l}_i\sim Normal_2 ({\bf s}_i,\Sigma)
\]
we can estimate $\sigma$ as well as ${\bf s}_{i}$ for the collared individuals directly from telemetry locations, using their full conditional distributions:
\[
[\sigma|{\bf l},{\bf s}] \propto \left\{\prod_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} exp\left(-1/2 \left[ \frac {l_{ix}-s_{ix}} {\sigma^2} + \frac{l_{iy}-s_{iy}}{\sigma^2} \right]\right)\right\}*[\sigma] 
\] 
and
\[
[{\bf s}_{i}|{\bf l}_{i},\sigma] \propto \left\{\frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} exp\left(-1/2 \left[ \frac {l_{ix}-s_{ix}} {\sigma^2} + \frac{l_{iy}-s_{iy}}{\sigma^2} \right]\right)\right\}*[{\bf s}_{i}] 
\]
XXXXX ANYONE - I am pretty sure that's what the BVN pdf reduces to when covariance = 0, but would someone mind cross-checking? XXXXXX 
Under the standard mark-resight assumption that marked individuals are a representative sample of the population, the estimate of $\sigma$ can be applied for the entire population. For the unmarked individuals ${\bf s}_{i}$ are estimated as described before conditional on their latent encounter histories. 

{\bf R} makes it easy to implement the update of $\sigma$ and ${\bf s}_i$ based on telemetry data and the above described full conditionals within our existing MCMC algorithm. We simply replace the current updating step for $\sigma$ with: 

\begin{verbatim}
#ntot = number of telemetry-tagged individuals
#locs = list of length ntot; each element is a matrix 
#with telemetry locations
#telID = vector with identifier for telemetry-tagged
#individuals

sigma.cand <- rnorm(1, sigma, tune[1])
if (sigma.cand > 0) {

llsig<-llsig.cand<-rep(NA, ntot) 

for (x in 1:ntot) {
lls[x]<-sum(dmvnorm(x=locs[[x]],mean=c(S[telID[x],1],S[telID[x],2]), 
			sigma=cbind(c(sigma^2,0), c(0,sigma^2)), log=T))   
lls.cand[x]<-sum(dmvnorm(x=locs[[x]],mean=c(S[telID[x],1],S[telID[x],2]), 
	sigma=cbind(c(sigma.cand^2,0), c(0,sigma.cand^2)), log=T))   
	}
   if(runif(1) < exp( sum(lls.cand)  - sum(lls) ) ){
    sigma<-sigma.cand
    lam <- lam0*exp(-(D*D)/(2*sigma.cand*sigma.cand))
					}
			}
\end{verbatim} 
For ${\bf s}$ we use an analogous updater for the telemetry-tagged individuals and the regular updater for individuals without associated telemetry location information. A full example code can be found in the {\bf R} package {\tt scrbook}, by calling {\tt scrPID.telemetry}. Note that not all marked individuals need to be telemetry-tagged. This approach of incorporating telemetry data into a spatial mark-resight model can easily be extended to update $\sigma$ and ${\bf s}$ conditional on both resighting and telemetry data and applies equally to regular SCR models where all individuals are identifiable.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we extended the spatial model for unmarked populations to a mark-resight situation, where part of the population is individually identifiable, usually through artificial tags. The basic model with known number of marked individuals and 100 \% individual identification of marked is easily modified for situations where the number of marked individuals is unknown, or where marked animals can sometimes not be identified to individual level. As expected, having marked individuals in the study population improved accuracy and precision of parameter estimates when compared to fully unmarked populations, but we also saw that the spatial counts of unmarked individuals still contribute information to parameter estimates. Finally, we present an approach of how to incorporate telemetry location data into the spatial mark-resight model to inform estimates of $\sigma$ and activity centers. Especially for difficult-to-study, cryptic species where often only a small sample of the population can be tagged this enables researchers to make optimal use of all existing data and obtain robust density estimates without the need for additional invasive methods. 
Beyond the models presented in this chapter, just as SCR, the spatial mark-resight model framework is flexible to account for a variety of factors that may influence individual movement and detection, as well as survey-related parameters. As such, the approach is applicable to a wide range of population estimation problems when dealing with animals that cannot be identified based on natural marks.
