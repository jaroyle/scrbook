\begin{abstract}

  Capture-recapture studies are widely used to obtain demographic
  information about animal populations. While these studies are
  inherently spatial, spatially explicit models for {\it inference} have
  only recently been developed and become accessible to practioners.
  Historically, {\it sampling design} of capture-recapture studies has
  been ad hoc or based on heuristic considerations related to
  knowledge of animal home range size.  In this paper I formalize the
  linkage between a class of models suitable for inference in some
  capture-recapture studies (e.g., based on camera trapping) and
  sampling design for those studies.  Exploiting the structural
  relationship between this class of models and standard generalized
  linear models, I note that the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix
  of model parameters exists in closed form. The variance-covariance
  matrix depends explicitly on the sample locations. As such, standard
  concepts in model-based design can be used to find the configuration
  of sample locations that is optimal for estimating model parameters
  or functions of them.  Spatial design for capture-recapture studies
  has much in common with classical spatial design including so-called
  space-filling designs. These designs are not model-based but,
  conceptually, they seek minimize the expected closeness of
  individuals to the array. I suggest that space-filling designs may
  serve as a robust alternative to formal model-based designs or
  initial designs prior to the availability of data to which models
  can be fitted.

\section{Introduction}


The use of spatial arrays of traps or detection devices to study
animal populations is pervasive in ecology.  For example, camera
trapping (Karanth 1995; Karanth and Nichols 1998), arrays of live traps (Wilson and
Anderson 1985a,b), or DNA sampling devices (Gardner et al. 2009) are commonly
used for sampling populations in order to obtain information about
abundance or density and other population attributes.  Recent advances
in the development of spatially explicit models for inference from
such data provide a flexible and rigorous framework for inference
about abundance or density (Borchers and Efford 2008; Royle and Young
2008; Royle and Gardner 2009) as well as vital rate parameters
(Gardner et al. in review) such as survival and recruitment.

Statistical design is recognized as an important component of animal
population studies (Morrison et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2003).
Commonly, design is thought of in terms of number of samples to take,
when to sample, methods of capture, desired sample size (of
individuals), power of tests, and related considerations.  In the
context of spatial sampling problems, where populations of mobile
animals are sampled by an array of traps or devices, a critical design
element is the spacing and configuration of the trapping array.  While
conceptual and heuristic design considerations have been addressed by
a number of authors (e.g., Nichols and Karanth 2002, Ch. 11), little
or no formal analysis focused on spatial design of arrays has been
carried out.  Some authors have addressed trap spacing and
configuration by sensitivity ``re-analysis'' (deleting traps and
reanalyzing; Wegge et al. 2004; Tobler et al. 2008), but it would be
natural also to consider a simulation-based approach in which the
precision of estimates is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation given a
number of prescribed design.  A heuristic based on recognizing the
importance of typical home range sizes (Dice 1938; 1941) and thus
being able to obtain information about home range size is that traps
should be spaced such that the array of available traps exposes as
many individuals as possible but, at the same time, individuals should
be captureable in multiple traps.  Thus trap spacing should be on the
same order as the radius of a typical home range (e.g., Dillon and
Kelly 2007).  As such, for example, cats with small home range centers
should require closer trap spacing than large wide-ranging cats. It is
interesting that typical designs seem to favor trap arrangements that
are uniformly distributed and equally spaced. We will see that
optimal designs may not be as such.

%A broad class of spatial capture-recapture models can be represented
%as a generalized linear model (GLM) with an individual random effect
%(Royle et al. 2009; Royle and Gardner 2009)
%representing a latent spatial attribute of individuals, interpretable loosely
% as the center of activity or home range center (Efford 2004; Borchers
%and Efford 2008; Royle and Young 2008).
%This formulation makes analysis of the models readily
%accessible in freely available software and also allows us to adapt 
%and use concepts from this broad class of models to solve problems in
%spatial capture recapture.

%\footnote{As an historical note, a referee
%  (of Gardner et al. ) commented ``The analogy with Poisson regression
%  doesn't seem to add anything -- all we're talking about is
%  constructing a (possibly linear) predictor that keeps the predicted
%  values in the feasible range.'' In a sense, this paper provides a
%demonstration of the utility of having a broader view about model
%formulation. i.e., its not just a matter of keeping ``predicted values
%in the feasible range'' but rather exploiting the relationship to
%provide new solutions to existing problems, such as design.
%In fact, we can
%draw on this analogy with this broader class of problems to solve
%important problems in spatial capture-recapture.  In particular, in
%this paper I will use the equivalence to provide a definitive solution
%for one class of spatial capture-recapture models that is based on the
%formulation of those models as Poisson generalized linear mixed models
%(GLMMs). So, Mr. referee, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
%}

In this paper we draw on well-established model-based design concepts
(Kiefer 1959; Box and Draper 1959, 1987; Fedorov 1972;
 Sacks et al. 1989; Hardin
and Sloane 1993; Fedorov and Hackl 1997; M$\ddot{u}$ller 
2007) to develop a framework for
designing spatial trapping arrays for capture-recapture
studies. Specifically, we consider obtaining the configuration of traps
(or sampling devices) in some region (the design space, ${\cal X}$), 
that minimizes certain variance criterion such as the variance of
estimating $N$, the variance of the MLEs of the
detection model parameters based on the asymptotic variance-covariance
matrix, or functions of both. 
%Existing theory (Sanathanan 1972) suggests that such designs
%should also be optimal for estimating density or abundance.  
%For a
%design based on $J$ trap locations, the resulting $2J-$dimensional
%optimization problem is computationally challenging. To solve this
%problem I use sequential exchange or swapping algorithms which have
%been widely used to solve high-dimensional optimization problems
%(Mitchell 1974; Meyer and Nachtsheim 1995; Nychka et al. 1997).


The paper is organized as follows....


We will see that the design is sensitive to the
state-space ${\cal S}$ which defines a point process governing the
distribution of individuals over the study area.  One solution to the
problem is to equate the state-space to the design space. i.e., set
${\cal S} = {\cal X}$.
}  That is probably reasonable, although it will
seldom be the case that the they are equal in practice. For example,
${\cal X}$ would usually be defined by a park boundary or some other invisible
line delineating where biologists are allowed, feel secure, or have
permission to place camera traps whereas ${\cal S}$ is often much
larger and probably difficult to describe precisely. Nevertheless, in
the case where $N$ is known or specified then we must also specify
${\cal S}$.  Following the development of basic ideas for the
known-$N$ case, I consider the unknown $N$ situation.  The basic
heuristic is that individuals far away from the design won't
contribute much information (in expectation) and so they should
therefore be weighted less in the construction of the design
criterion.  As it turns out, a theoretical development of this problem
by developing the observation model conditional on encounter yields a
result that is consistent with the heuristic consideration of
weighting variance by a function of distance from the trapping array.

WE consider a number of examples, under different scenarios, to
investigate the characteristics of the resulting optimal designs.  
Designs were computed in the free software {\bf R} (R Development Core
Team 2004).  I close with a discussion of some interesting conceptual
linkages with a class of spatial designs based on distance, and
recommendations for future research.




\section{The Design Problem for Spatial Capture-Recapture Studies}
\label{sec.design}

Let ${\cal X}$, the {\it design space}, denote some region within
which sampling could occur and let ${\bf X} = {\bf x}_{1},\ldots, {\bf
  x}_{J}$ denote the {\it design}, the set of sample locations (e.g.,
of camera traps) which henceforth will be referenced as ``traps.'' The
technical problem addressed in this paper is how to choose the
locations ${\bf X}$ in a manner that is statistically efficient for
estimating abundance or density.  The design space, ${\cal X}$, which
determines potential design points, will have to be prescribed.  This
could be some polygon describing a park or forest unit from which
we may choose trap locations.  Further, while ${\cal X}$ maybe be
continuous, 
in practice it will be sufficient to represent ${\cal X}$ by a
discrete collection of points.  This is especially convenient when
the geometry of ${\cal X}$ is complicated and irregular (which would
be in most practical applications).

The models considered here are based on the notion that individuals
have a static spatial location about which their movements are
concentrated and which can be related to trap-specific encounter
probabilities by distance alone.  The models regard the population of
$N$ such individual ``activity centers'' as the outcome of a point
process.  Denote the home range center of an individual by the coordinate
${\bf s}$ which is regarded
as the outcome of a random variable
uniformly distributed over the state-space ${\cal S}$, some
2-dimensional region.  The importance of ${\cal S}$ is obvious as it
defines a population of individuals (i.e., activity centers) and, in
practice, it is not usually the same as ${\cal X}$ due to the fact
that animals move freely over the landscape and the location of traps
is typically restricted by policies, ownership and other
considerations. That ${\cal X}$ and ${\cal S}$ are not the same is the
basic problem of geographic non-closure of the population for which
spatial capture-recapture models have been devised (Efford 2004; 
Borchers and
Efford 2008; Royle and Young 2008; Royle and Gardner 2009).

We adopt a class of models (Royle et al. 2009; Royle and Gardner 2009)
which assume that, conditional on an individual's activity center,
${\bf s}_{i}$, the encounter frequency for individual $i$ in trap $j$
is a Poisson random variable
\[
 y_{ij}|{\bf s}_{i} \sim \mbox{Bern}( p(s_{i}, x_{j}) )
\]
with
\[
logit(p(s,x)) = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} || s_{i} - x_{j} ||^2
\]
Conditional on $s_{i}$, this is a basic logic model with
\begin{equation}
  logit(p(s,x))  =  {\bf m}({\bf s}_{i})' {\bm \alpha}
\label{eq.linearpredictor}
\end{equation}
for ${\bf m}({\bf s}_{i})' = (1,||{\bf s}_{i} - {\bf x}_{j}||^{2})$
and regression parameters ${\bm \alpha} =( \alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1})$.

\section{An Estimator of $N$ and Variance criteria}

We consider a conditional estimator of $N$ from Alho (XXXX) of the
form
\[
  \tilde{N}  = \sum_{i=1}^{N}  \frac{z_{i}}{\phi_{i}}
\]
where $z_{i}$ is a binary indicator of capture ($z_{i}=1$ if
individual $i$ appears in the sample, $z_{i}=0$ otherwise) and
$\phi_{i} = Pr(z_{i}=1)$ is the probability of capture which depends
on parameters ${\bm \alpha}$. 
In the SCR
model we consider an individual is captured if it is captured in {\it
  any} trap and therefore
\[
 \phi_{i} = 1 - \prod_{j=1}^{J} (1- p_{ij})
\]
keeping in mind that this is conditional on ${\bf s}_{i}$.  

To proceed, we express the conditioning of $\tilde{N}$ on ${\bm \alpha}$
explicitly by writing (following the notation of Alho XXXX) the estimator as
\[
 \tilde{N}(\hat{\theta}) =  \tilde{N}_{1}(\hat{\bm \alpha}) + . ... +
 \tilde{N}_{N}(\hat{\bm \alpha})
\]

Alho provides the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for the
estimator of $N$. We build this conditional on $s$ and then
``uncondition on $s$'' and also uncondition on $z$

The variance of $\tilde{N}$ {\it conditional on } ${\bf z}$ is
(Alho XXXX)
\[
 Var(\tilde{N}(\alpha) | {\bf z}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} {\bf v}_{i}(\alpha)'
 Cov(\hat{\alpha}|M) {\bf v}_{i}(\alpha) 
\]
where 
\[
 {\bf v}_{i}({\bm \alpha}) = \left( \frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i} }{\delta \alpha_{0}}
\frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i} }{\delta \alpha_{1}}
\right)
\]
The chain rule yields
\[
 \frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{0}} = -\frac{z_{i}}{\phi_{i}^{2}} \left( \frac{\delta
   \phi_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{0}}\right)
\]
and, similarly, .....
\[
 \frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{1}} = 
\]
we need to identify the derivatives of of phi[i] with respect to
alpha0 and alpha1.......
\[
\frac{ \delta \phi_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{0}} = 
\]
\[
\frac{ \delta \phi_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{1}} = 
\]
So we plug these into XYZ above for ${\bf v}_{i}$ .... but note that ....
Since we're doing this in the context of design where we don't
actually observe {\it any} individuals, we don't have the $z_{i}$
variables in these expressions. For that we replace $z_{i}$ by its
expectation $\phi_{i}$ to produce the following modifications of these
expressions 
\[
 \frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{0}} = -\frac{1}{\phi_{i}} \left( \frac{\delta    \phi_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{0}}\right)
\]
and, similarly, .....
\[
 \frac{ \delta \tilde{N}_{i}}{\delta \alpha_{1}} = 
\]






Ok, so here is the basic exxpression which is conditional on 
s[i], so we should average the variance
over all possible locations of s[i]. Lets make a grid of $G$ such
points.....


\[
 Var(\tilde{N}(\alpha) | {\bf z}) = 
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \int_{s_{i} \in {\cal s}}   {\bf v}_{i}(\alpha,s[i])'
 Cov(\hat{\alpha}|M) {\bf v}_{i}(\alpha)  d{\bf s}_{i} 
\]

here's where we have to be delicate.....






Note variance .....
is a 
 function of the design ${\bf X}$ as well as ${\bf s}$ both of which
 are balled-up in ${\bf M}$ --
the regression design matrix, and the matrix ${\bf D}$ which is a diagonal
matrix having elements $\mbox{Var}( y_{j}|{\bf s}) = exp({\bf
  m}'{\ubeta})$ for $y_{j}$ the frequency of encounter in trap $j$.
Where am I going with this?  The idea is to develop design criteria
based on this asymptotic variance. Because it is conditional on 
the design points ${\bf X}$, we might think about trying to 
find the set of design poins that minimizes some function of this
matrix. e.g., if we focus on its
determinant,  
this is the standard ``D-optimal'' criterion (Mitchell 1974;
Hardin and Sloane 1993; Box and Draper 1997) widely used in classical
experimental design for estimating response surfaces. We have to deal
with two technical issues: First, that the random variables ${\bf s}$
are unknown and also that there are $N$ individuals (each with its own
${\bf s}$).

Given that the variance is expressed conditional on ${\bf s}$, a
latent variable, a natural thing to do is to average this variance
over possible values of ${\bf s}$, and seek to locate design points to
minimize the integrated variance of the regression coefficients. In
the present context, we would integrate over ${\cal S}$.  Thus, a
heuristically appealing 
design criterion is
\begin{equation}
Q({\bf X}) =  \sum_{ {\bf s} \in {\cal S} }
|\mbox{Var}(\hat{\ubeta}|{\bf X},{\bf s})|
\label{eq.Q}
\end{equation}
This is easy enough to evaluate for a discrete ${\cal S}$. In fact,
the determinant can be computed analytically and the calculations
vectorized for efficient calculation. It seems reasonalbe that
designs that have small values of 
Eq. (\ref{eq.Q}) should be preferred. Ideally, we might hope to find 
the design that minimizes Eq. (\ref{eq.Q}) over all possible designs
of a fixed dimension. This is discussed in the following Section.








In the next Section I discuss how we optimize this or any other
criterion over the design space.
There is one thing  to contend with and that is as distance 
to the design gets large then the Information contributed by an
individual goes to 0.  However, so too does the inverse of the
information matrix (since the off-diagonals are also tending to 0 at
the same rate).  This can cause some numerical instability for large
${\cal S}$ so that I do is a check on the determinant and if it is
$< 10^{-10}$ I exclude those elements from the summation. 


{\it Invariance of design to effort -- } One very useful property of
the criterion given by Eq. (\ref{eq.Q}) is that the optimal design is
invariant to sampling effort.  In particular, note that the diagonal
element ${\bf D}$ factors to include a term $exp(\beta_{0})$ which
doesn't depend on space (or, in particular, the design). In general,
``effort'' or the number of samples, will influence the mean as an
additive offset. For example if $\beta_{0}$ is the baseline for a
single survey interval (typically, a night in the case of camera
traps) and the survey will be run for $K$ nights then the baseline
expected encounter frequency is $K \times exp(\beta_{0})$.  Thus, as
we expect heuristically, the amount of effort we expend sampling (over
time) does not influence the spatial configuration of traps.

{\it Influence of population size -- }
%When the activity centers of $N$ individuals ${\bf s}_{i};
%i=1,2,\ldots,N$ are independent, the magnitude of $N$ does not
%influence the design because the information contributed by each
%individual is additive. The resulting criterion will scale the
%expression given above by $1/N$, the number of individuals in the
%population.  
However, clearly it is reasonable that 
the criterion should be sensitive to
the size of the state-space ${\cal S}$ because this defines the
population of individuals that is the focus of inference.  Design
points are going to try to minimize the expected variance, where the
expectation is taken over space (i.e., ${\cal S}$). The design will
try to maximize exposure of all points in ${\cal S}$. 
This is typical of 
other spatial design problems. For example, for designs based on
optimal prediction variance using random field models, ${\cal S}$ will
represent the region over which predictions are desired or otherwise
defines the scope of inference (see Discussion).  This is problematic
from a practical point of view in capture-recapture studies because we
may not be able to delineate a population of interest in a precise
way. In that case then we might restrict attention to the design space
and set ${\cal S} = {\cal X}$.  The issue of sensitivity to ${\cal S}$
is resolved in Section \ref{sec.unknownN}.








\section{Optimization of the criterion}

In formulating the optimization problem note that we have $J$ sample
locations corresponding to rows of ${\bf X}$.  The problem is a $2J$
dimensional optimization problem which, for $J$ small, could be solved
using standard numerical optimization algorithms as exist in almost
every statistical computation environment.  However, $J$ will almost
always be large enough so as to preclude effective use of such
algorithms. This is a common problem in experimental design, design
for response surface estimation, computer experiments, spatial
sampling designs and other disciplines for which sequential exchange
or swapping algorithms can be used (e.g., Wynn 1970; 
Fedorov 1972; Mitchell 1974; Meyer and
Nachtsheim 1995). The basic idea is to pose the problem as a sequence
of 1-dimensional optimization problems in which the objective function
is optimized over 1 or several coordinates at a time.

In the present case, we consider swapping out ${\bf x}_{j}$ for some
point in ${\cal X}$ that is nearby ${\bf x}_{j}$ (e.g., a 1st order
neighbor). The objective function is evaluated for all possible swaps
(at most 4 in the case of 1st order neighbors) and whichever point
yields the biggest improvement is swapped for the current value.  The
algorithm is iterated over all $J$ design points and this continues
until convergence is achieved. Such algorithms may yield local optima
and optimization for a number of random initial designs can yield
incremental improvements. I implemented this swapping algorithm in
{\bf R}, using the basic strategy employed elsewhere (e.g., Nychka et
al. 1997; Royle and Nychka 1998).  A version of a swapping
algorithm used to optimize a space-filling criterion is implemented
in the {\bf R} package {\bf
  fields} (Fields Development Team 2006).  We developed an
  implementation that requires
a discrete representation of ${\cal S}$ (an aribtrary matrix of
coordinates) and an indicator of which elements of ${\cal S}$ are
members of the design space ${\cal X}$. For each point in ${\bf X}$, only 
the nearest neighbors (the number is specified) are considered for
swapping into the design during each iteration.  

While swapping algorithms are convenient to implement, and efficient
at reducing the criterion in very high dimensional problems, they do
not always yield the global optimum.  In practice, as in the examples
below, it is advisable to apply the algorithm to a large number of
random starting designs.  My experience is that essentially
meaningless improvements are realized after searching through a few
dozen random starts.


\section{Illustration}


Consider designing a study for camera traps in a square region defined
by the square $[10,20] \times [10, 20]$ and with ${\cal X} = {\cal
  S}$.  For this illustration I assumed $\beta_{0} = log(\lambda_{0})
= -2.7$ and $\beta_{1} = 1/(\sigma^{2}) = 1/4$, $1/9$ and $1/16$, so
$\sigma = 2,3,4$. (this was dumb - note that $\sigma$ is really 2
times the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Oh well!).
Designs of size 9 and 10 were computed for each value of $\sigma$
using many random starting designs.  The putative optimal designs
(henceforth ``best'') are shown\footnote{My intention is to provide
  many of these results in an Appendix in order to reduce the length
  of the paper.} in Figure \ref{fig.fig1}.  For J=9, $\sigma =2$, the
best design was produced in 180 out of 1000 random starts.  For
$\sigma = 3$ (row 2, left panel) the best design was produced in about
88\% of all optimizations from random starting values.
%reason is that there are a lot of points in the interior that interact
%relatively little with the design and these ``holes'' tend to cause
%the algorithm to get caught in a local optimum (my interpretation) of
%the objective function.  Or, consider this, with sigma = small the
%design can probably be translated a little bit in space .... this is
%what I think happens.  
For $J=10$, and $\sigma =2$ (row 1, right panel), the best design was
found about 24\% of the time (from random starts). 
The $\sigma = 3$ best design (row 2, right
panel; 14\% of random starts) clusters 2 points in the center.
Finally, consider the $\sigma =4$ case (last row of
Fig. \ref{fig.fig1}).  We have two irregular looking designs and 
the design points cluster in various ways. 
% For $J=9$ this was produced
%only 1 time whereas only 8 instances of 1000 produced the
%best design for $J=10$.  We might thus have little confidence in that
%result\footnote{subsequent analyses have failed to find a better
%  design.}. 

I computed the best designs using the same settings but inreasing the
size of ${\cal S}$ relative to ${\cal X}$.  In particular, I nested
${\cal X}$ into $[9,21] \times [9,21]$ (Figure \ref{fig.fig2})
 and then $[8,22]^{2}$ (Figure \ref{fig.fig3}).
The obvious effect of this is
that the best designs move points toward the edge of the design space
${\cal X}$ so as to provide more exposure to points in ${\cal S}$.
The effect is more pronounced, obviously, as you provide more area
outside of ${\cal X}$ that is allowed to influence the design.

As a final example, 
consider placing 20 camera traps in this region. Where do they
go? Look at the 3 buffers, 3 values of sigma, thats 9 total designs
(use a single panel).
An interesting feature of the designs is that they are not
regular. Traps occur in clusters of several traps close together
with the clusters more widely spaced.

\subsection{Effectiveness of the sequential exchange algorithm}

The sequential swapping algorithm always converges but may frequently
find a local optimum of the $2J$-dimensional objective function. In
some cases it is instructive to inspect different local optima and
this seems to usually indicate that they are variations on a theme,
with the points in clusters but locked into a slightly sub-optimal
configuration. This is partially
aided by changing the number of nearest neighbors considered for
swapping at each iteration and I suspect other modifications can be
made to improve the effectiveness.

If multiple equivalent solutions are found based on random starts,
then I interpret this as evidence that the global optimum was
found. e.g., if based on 1000 starts we find the same best design many
times then it may be reasonable to regard the modal design as the
global optimum.  Otherwise we can examine the relative closelness
of the local optima and it seems to always be the case that, when
there is not a modal best design, 
the best solutions vary by fractional percentages of the
criterion. At that point we probably don't care too much given
logistical and practical constraints on trap placement anyways. e.g.,
if a point falls in a lake or river it wouldn't make too much sense to
put it there.

Most of the optimizations used to compute the figures XXX-YYY were
based on at least 1000 random starts. For cases where the best design
occurred only once, I ran a follow-up run with 10000 random starts.
I summarized the
frequency with which the best solution was found and the
corresponding criteroin value using 4 nearest neighbors considered for
swapping into the design (Table XXXX).
We see 
that when sigma is small then....................
each point kind of creates a bubble around it so that a point can't
get to the other side if it has to. By inreasing nn then it can make a
big jump and get over there.  seems that higher nn or mixing them up
might be good. The algorithm is highly amenable to parallelization
etc... but I used a brute force implementation under which it would
usually take several hours to run through 2000 iterations.......
For the n=20 designs.... high clustering..... causes minor differences....
 However, I think the 2nd, 3rd, etc.. best designs are
almost irrelevant as they differ in fractional percentages of the
variance criterion. Thus, as a practical matter, it is not so
important to be conifdent that we have {\it the} optimal design.

\section{Discussion}

Almost all capture-recapture studies involve spatial sampling yet only
recently has the spatial dimension of such studies been formalized
using spatially explicit statistical models and contemporary methods
of inference (Borchers and Efford 2008; Royle and Young 2008).  Given
the formalization of the modeling and inference framework, it is
natural to consider using such models to inform sampling, as is done
in many branches of classical statistics (Box and Draper 1997; Fedorov
and Hackl 1997; M$\ddot{u}$ller 2007).

In this paper, we developed a framework for constructing spatial
sampling designs which are optimal for estimating model parameters
under a class of spatial capture-recapture models.  The class of
models assumes that encounter probabilities are a function of the 
distance between sample locations (i.e., traps) and an individual
latent 
variable representing home range or activity center.  

Adapting results from Alho (XXXX) we devise the asymptotic
variance-covariance matrix for the regression parameters  and for the
conditional estimator of $N$. We formulate design criteria based on
the {\it expectated value} of the  variances, averaged over the
state-space of the underlying random variables ${\bf s}$. Thus, the
resulting design criterion only depends on the sample locations.

As a result, the variance of model parameters (or
functions of them) can be minimized over any set of candidate sample
locations -- the design space -- ${\cal X}$.  I considered choosing
the sample points such that the generalized variance of the model
parameters is minimized.  This design will correspond to the optimum
design for estimating abundance or density also based on the results
of Sanathanan (1972).  The case where $N$ is not known, in which case
the all-zero individual encounter histories are not observable, can be
resolved by properly conditioning on the event that an individual is
observed in at least one trap. The probability mass function of the
observations in this case is a scaled (or truncated) Poisson, which is
also a member of the exponential family of distributions. The
asymptotic variance-covariance matrix resolves to an intuitive form in
which the ordinary variance criterion is weighted approximately by the
probability that an individual is encountered.
A useful property of optimal designs under this model
is that they are invariant to the amount of
effort or temporal sampling (length of time the traps are operational or 
replicates) by each trap.

I have evaluated the design framework 
under regular shaped regions which is not so
common in practice. However, a virtue of the framework is that arbitrary
configurations of ${\cal X}$ and ${\cal S}$ can be specified.
Even with regular ${\cal X}$ and ${\cal S}$, resulting designs may be
irregular (not symmetric). Moreover, a general feature of optimal
designs is that they 
often involve clusters of sample locations -- 2 or more traps forming
a cluster, and sometimes with  more of a systmatic distribution of clusters.
This is contrary to
practice where investigators seldom deviate from a regular, systematic
trap spacing.
A basic result of design for spatial capture-recapture, shared with
other spatial design contexts is that both ${\cal X}$ and ${\cal S}$
are important in determining the optimal design.  In classical spatial
design, as in spatial capture-recapture, the area over which
predictions are desired (corresponding to ${\cal S}$) might typically
be distinct from the region within which samples can be collected
(${\cal X}$).  
This is not something that has ever been
noted, or considered in practice to the best of my knowledge. Rather,
biologists just consider ${\cal X}$ in deciding where to place traps.
%Conversely, the relevance
%yet its relevance to {\it estimation} has been (e.g., Borchers
%and Efford 2008; Royle and Young 2008; Royle et al. 2009).  
Even under the conditional formulation of the model which,
heuristically, weights points in ${\cal S}$ by their distance to the
design, the size and configuration of ${\cal S}$ relative to ${\cal
  X}$ will influence the design.  For example, if a portion of ${\cal
  X}$ is bordered by a large body of water, then the resulting design
will be affected by that.
I have scarcely considered the influence of the number of traps on the
design criterion.
However, the proposed framework makes explicit this consideration
by the specification of a variance criterion that is influenced
directly, in a manner amenable to study, by both the number and
configuration of traps.
As such, it 
allows formal assessments to be made of the influence of different numbers
of traps under their optimal configuration which should be a component
of any study.  For example, 20 traps configured in a highly efficient
manner might be preferred to more traps configured in a standard, 
systematic manner. 


The framework is model based and so it is natural to question the
sensitivity or robustness of the design to model misspecification.
Two options arise in this case: It seems possible to extend the
framework to accomodate multiple models if one could pose such models
and, secondly, we could use designs that have a heuristic basis but
are not model-based. For example, it is clear that 
sampling design for spatial capture-recapture studies has much in
common with classical ``spatial design'' (M$\ddot{u}$ller 2007),
which are often used as ``exploratory'' designs when little is
known about the underlying form of the model.
The criterion for the class of models considered here is structurally
and conceptually similar to distance-based criteria used to construct
``space-filling'' designs (Johnson et al. 1990; Hardin and Sloane
1993; Nychka et al. 1997; M$\ddot{u}$ller 2007, Sec. 4.2).  For example, it seems sensible in the
context of spatial capture-recapture studies to attempt to minimize
the expected distance of an individual to the collection of sample
locations.  Thus, we might construct a criterion based on the total
distance of individual $i$ to the ``design'' (i.e., all trap
locations):
\begin{equation}
d({\bf s}_{i}, {\bf X}) =  \sum_{j}   ||{\bf s}_{i} - {\bf x}_{j} ||
\label{eq.d1}
\end{equation}
or perhaps the minimum distance to the trap array:
\begin{equation}
 d({\bf s}_{i},{\bf X}) = \stackrel{min}{{\bf u} \in {\bf X}} ||{\bf
   s} -{\bf u}||.
\label{eq.d2}
\end{equation}
Then the ``expected exposure'' (to the design) of individuals
in the state space ${\cal S}$ is
\begin{equation}
 Q({\bf X}) = 
\left(
 \sum_{{\bf s} \in {\cal S}} d({\bf  s},{\bf X}) \right)
\label{eq.spacefilling}
\end{equation}
Under distance metric (\ref{eq.d2}) this criterion is the so-called
uniform coverage design
(Fang and Wang 1994)
which is the U-criterion 
computed in PROC
OPTEX (SAS, 2004). Both metrics are special cases of a generalized
criterion (See Nychka et al. 1997) implemented in an {\bf R} library
{\tt Fields} (Fields Development Team 2006).  We see that elements of
the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of $\hat{\ubeta}$ are
structurally similar to this purely distance-based criterion, but with
an exponential weighting scheme.  Some investigation into the
connections between space-filling designs and those for spatial
capture-recapture models seems warranted.  As a practical matter, it
might be sensible to consider using space filling designs by default
as they may be reasonable compromises between alternative models, or
perhaps robust to model misspecification. Designs that minimize the
average distance between points in the state-space ${\cal S}$ and the
design should produce high total exposure of individuals to traps
under regular encounter models (e.g., that are monotone decreasing in
distance). In addition, space-filling designs may be useful as initial
designs (i.e., in 1st year studies) before data are available to
inform model parameters.
