The possible extensions of SCR are too numerous to include in a mere
single volume.
So instead we have a bunch of mini-chapters here.



\section{Aggregation}

Individuals get detected in groups such as females with cubs or
whatever.
This is an extreme form of clustering -- i.e., multiple individuals
with the same home range center.
[see Russell et al. 2012 paper with mountain lions].

Can we model clustering explicitly?

What about Poisson cluster processes, NEyman Scott processes, etc..?

Efford et al. 2009 EURING proceedings did a simulation study and found
no bias due to clustering....







\section{Combining Multiple SCR data}

\section{Telemetry?}
