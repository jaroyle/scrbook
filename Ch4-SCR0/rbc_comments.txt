A few things to look for:
 
 (1) I think some of the earlier sections maybe could be
 reorganized. thoughts on that? 
 
 (2) I tend to write too much stuff even if its not well thought
 out. do you see any sections that should be deleted or combined? 
 
 (3) maybe I went overboard on analyzing the wolverine data.
 
 (4) missing citations?  points to make?
 
 (5) bad or inconsistent notation? [i'm aware of some things already....]
 




Good stuff Andy. I think the organization could be improved somewhat,
but I need some more time to think about how to do that..



Need a better segue from section 4.2 to 4.3

Maybe sketch out the basics of a SCR model before going into the
details. Or even a one-liner like: "A SCR model assumes that there are N home range centers
within some area, and the probability of encountering an individual at
a trap is a function of the distance between the home range center and
the trap location"


I don't think people should have a problem with our use of the term
"home range". In my mind, a home range is just the area used by a
species in some period of time. That is how we use it here right? I
still think this section is worthwhile. 


Notation: I wonder if most ecologists would prefer "area of S"
instead of "area(S)" or "A(S)", as it is often presented in stats books.


Section 4.2 and Figure 4.2 could be dumbed down



Why is it ok to allow water to be considered as habitat? Wouldn't the
results be different if you used a more realistic state-space?
