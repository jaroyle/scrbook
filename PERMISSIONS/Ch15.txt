Canada geese example
Use of parts of the Canada geese study as example in the book was agreed upon before the analysis was conducted. Beth emailed Liz, Moorman and DePerno 
about the idea on December 1 2011. They were given the opportunity to revise the example via email between March 18 and 20 2012.

Rahel (cc beth) emailed Liz, C. DePerno and C. Moorman (NCSU) on May 18 about use of data for R package on May 18 and got written permission from C. Moorman 
to use data given that Liz' thesis and/or publications are cited within the R package. 


Raccoon example
Rahel emailed Ted Simons and Allan O'Connell about using the raccoon study as an example. Ted Simons agreed via email on Aug 15 2012 so long as the raccoon example is 
just a small part of the chapter.
