Chapter 1


Chapter 1b


Chapter 2

(a) Get a new binomial example

(b) GoF stuff is probably rubbish. Take that out?


Chapter 3


Chapter 4

(a) Why is JAGS not working for wolverine discrete state-space?
 -- FIX THIS PROBLEM
 
(b) Need material on implied home range/space usage .....

(c) Add section with a clear statement of assumptions: Bivariate
normal , stationary, home range.   iid actiivtyh centers -- no
clustering -- no gradient -- etc... Cite Efford et al. 2009 on effect
of clustering -- Note that these assumptions can all be relaxed and
arguments about "truth" are red herrings.
The other argument is "iid" detections.


Chapter 7: MCMC

Improve the tuning in the bear analysis
Add Geweke statistic to sueful commands section
Can we run partial ID models in BUGS? 
Add material on ParallelBUGS

Chapter 9: Modeling encounter probability

(a) Beth: Can you put in wildcat analysis?
(b) Try running this in JAGS maybe faster?
(c) Need some brief discussion of model Mh and home range area heterogeneity

Chaper 10:

put nlm() output from example of fitting models.
