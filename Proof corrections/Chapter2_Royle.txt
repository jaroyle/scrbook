Equation 2.1.1  -- there is a serious error here. The x and K in the 
combinatorial are reversed.

p. 23: the two verbatim blocks at the end of the page are different sizes.
I suggest decreasing by 1 point the part on o0020-o0025


Table 2.1:  the pdf expression for the binomial and multinomial:
There needs to be open-paren and close paren around the combinatorial terms
(lines 3 and 4 of the table)


p. 27: maybe add a line after line 2 of this verbatim block here.


p. 28: colon instead of period on line 6 after K=3

p. 28: the two blocks of verbatim text here are a bit small. I think
we're stuck with this though.



p. 29, paragraph 0165, line 2: insert "with color bands" after "are marked"
delete "with color bands" on the next line



p. 30, footnote:  2^{K-1} should be 2^{K} - 1



p. 31, paragraph 0210, line 5:  insert "conditional on the total" between 
words "then" and "the" 

p. 33, paragraph 0235, end:  change period to colon after rho=0.9

p. 33, after this verbatim block: I feel like the "Figure 2.2 ... " text
should be left justified.   It is part of the paragraph.


p. 35, line 11: "normally distributed" should just be "normal"

p. 35, paragraph 0260, last line:   reversing the arguments in the bracket
represntation of the distribution is wrong.
should be:
{\cal L}(\lambda|{\bf y}) = [y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n} | \lambda]

The pmf doesn't change arguments.


p. 35, Eq. 2.3.2:   the f() should be bracket notation []


p. 36, line 5: this looks a bit goofy to me. Is there an extra open paren 
here?

p. 36,  line o0190:  leading "0" on this line is funky


p. 37: paragraph 0300, line 14:  do you need a + and a - in this equation?

p. 37, same paragraph: end the paragraph with a colon, not a period.



p. 38, the two equations near the end.  For both pairs (the top pair and
the bottom pair) you have [X,Y] and [Y,X]. I think this is confusing. You
could just have [X,Y] for both. 

p. 40, eq. 2.4.2:  again a + and a -

p. 40, n0005: instead of semi-colon here, end with a period. 

p. 40, paragraph 0355: maybe have a multiplication sign in "z p" in the
binomial expression

p. 41, line 9: "elements of the model" how about just "processes" ?

p, 43: line 7: need a "squared" term in the distance

p. 43, eq. 2.6.2 need a close paren on the Bernoulli

p. 44, paragraph 0425: open paren in front of Efford, close paren
after Royle et al. 2011b.
THEN: remove the open, close parens in-between.

p. 45,  after the integral equation add "at fixed locations"
after "SCR sampling"

p. 45, end of item #2: change "Chapters 12 and 13" to "Chapter 13"

p. 45, item #3:  "described in Chapter 15."
