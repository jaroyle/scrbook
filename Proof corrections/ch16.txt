In the next few paragraphs.....



Multi-state models are closely related to the SCR models we have talked 
about throughout this book.
In particular, keeping with the notion of having a discrete state variable
(e.g., river segment in the shad example), 
instead of having a Markovian state-transition model,
we imagine that each fish has a "home area" and the observation state
is conditioned on that (fixed) home area.
We might express that model as
\[
u_{it}|s \sim dcat(psi(s) )
\]
where u_{it} (a discrete state) is the current location of fish i, and
s (also a discrete state) is its home area. We could imagine that
the state-transition probability vector, psi(s), is related in some
fashion to distance between possible observation states and home area.
In this model, the current state, u_{it}, is not Markovian but, rather,
an independent sample from a distribution indexed by s. We see that,
by  letting  the  number  of  possible   states   increase  to  infinity, 
the model transmogrifies into a continuous space SCR model except
u_{it}   can   take  on  any   value  in  the   state-space   (this   type  of
"search-encounter"
model was discussed in Chapter 15). If we restrict the potential
observation locations to some prescribed subset of the state-variable
s, e.g., trap locations, then the model is precisely an SCR model for a
fixed trap array.
