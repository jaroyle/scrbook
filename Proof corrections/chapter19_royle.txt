This is one of the cleanest chapters for sure -- nice work!

p0085, eq 19.1.1: change asterisk to mulitplication


p0095 line 5: seems like you need a comma after "population" ;)

p. 505, line 5: I would switch the italics from spatial to
fundamentally ?

p0100 really nice point here about S being part of the design. 

p0110, maybe 2 commas , before and after "by design"

p 506 last equation: delete parentheses

p 507, last line: insert "you" after "allows"



p 508: the block of courier material here is too small. I think we
discussed having them shrink all of it to match this size. I don't
know if thats the best, general solution.......  Seems like they could
+1 point this by carrying 1 line of material onto the next line

Also o0140 - o0150 or so, that stuff should be indented.


Table 19.1 is terrible in the usual ways:
(a) integers in top and 5th row need ".00" added to them.
(b) center the "Parameter" column

p. 510: this block of courier material could be bigger possibly.
Either way, o0200 should be indented.

Table 19.2:  Integers in rows 1 and 2 should have .00 added to them.
o/w this is decent.

p0225: The sentence "the assumption that failure to identify...."
occurs twice in this paragraph  [if not 3 times!]  Delete either 1 or
2 instances.

Table 19.3: center the "Parameter" column. 

Figure 19.2:  instead of "for four levels" how about "using 4 sample
sizes"

Table 19.4: center "Parameter" field. 

p0255: where you have bold I to represent a location, we have
previously in a number of sections used "u"
Is it possible to change?
This wouldn't be a big deal.... some inconsistency in notation is ok.

p0260: I think you need a comma after "before" ;)

p0265: I would delete the leading "Again"

p. 520: the block of courier font -- I think this should be smaller to
match previous. 

Table 19.5:
 (a) "Posterior summary statistics" instead of "Summary statistics of
 posterior distributions"
 (b) Sollmann et al. citation needs the open-paren moved to the
 right. 
 (c) the integers need a .00 after them
 (d) add a space before the SE's in column 2
 (e) add "Parameter" to column 1 heading. 

p0290: Sollmann et al. (in revision):  2013b

p0295: "all previously developed" how about just "existing"

p0295, 2nd line to end: "as at the time" could be "because, at the
time" easier to read i think.

Section 19.7.1: In chapter 15 and I think elsewhere we used {\cal X}
to represent an area being searched -- kind of the same idea as a
trap, so instead of x we used {\cal X} to represent an area. 
Would it be possible to change from {\cal B} to {\cal X}?

Fig 19.4: if you change to {\cal X} then a few symbols on this graphic
need changed. It might be tough to do that.

p. 524, Equation: Switch the binomial arguments.

p. 524, mid-page:  change * to multiplication sign. 

Lots of {\cal B} on this page.

p. 526: "moving activity centers" how about "temporally dynamic
activity centers" or just "dynamic activity centers"?  

p 527, line 1: "usually" how about "often"

p 528: line 1: references are out of date order


Abstract, line 10: "upon which" should be "in which"?
