Chapter 17 (Developing Markov chain monte Carlo samplers) was reviewed by two reviewers:

(1) Brian Reich, North Carolina State University
(2) Earvin Balderama, North Carolina State University

Brian Reich reviewed an earlier draft of this chapter (the pdf named 'previewCh17-MCMC_BR.pdf') and made a
number of helpful comments mostly referring to technical details and background concerning the presentation of
the material; we addressed most of them,with the exception of those that we deemed would go too deeply into 
theory for the purpose of this chapter.  


Earvin Balderama read the submitted version of the chapter, previously reviewed by Brian Reich. 
His comments mostly related to style and puctuation, and we addressed all of those
(actually, many of them were automatically resolved in the typesetting process).

None of the reviewers raised any major concern.
