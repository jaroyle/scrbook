p0035, last sentence: delete "with each other"

p0040 "i.i.d." - no periods, put in italics

p0040  same thing occurs again


p. 316, p0080:  here you use n(x) to mean population size at pixel x.
In previous chapters (multiple chapters) I used N(x) to be the population
size of pixel x.  Would you mind changing that?  I think this occurs twice
in this paragraph.
[this is optional because it doesn't affect the development of things]


p. 317: you use |S| to be area, I used ||S||. Doesn't need changed and
I'm not really sure which is the correct notation.

p. 317, p0090:  ref to Chapter 9 here should be Chapter 6 I think. 

p. 318, p0115:  For the distribution of the activity centers you have s_{1},
...s_{N} in the bracket notation enclosed by curly braces.  I don't think the
curly braces are necessary (occurs twice in that paragraph)


p. 321, p0140: random comment not to do anything about: The difference
in SEs is an illustration of, I think, that specifying M is a very very
slight bit of information about N and also the rest of the parameters
thus you get a slight decrease in SE which diminishes as M increases.
This is cool!  I wonder if we should say this explicitly either by adding
a new sentence or a footnote. It is a cool heuristic for people to 
understand the two models.


p. 322, p0155: "simulation" should be "simulate"

p. 324, table 11.1:  add "fit to simulated data." in caption.
All of the columns should be centered in the field (numbers remaining 
right justified). 

p. 324, p0165:  to do the continuous pdf in BUGS I think you can use the 
"ones trick" or whatever as in the Advanced BUGS Tricks documentation.

p. 324, p0170: Ref to Mollet et al. in review has a misplaced open paren.


p. 326, table 11.2:  Column 1 could be centered to look better.
Also, in the 2.5% column there is a single number that is out-of-whack.

p. 329, Table 11.3:  Same old stuff here. 
 (a) column 1 -- center within the field
 (b) the numbers are not justified in this table at all.
 (c) Suggest removing 1 decimal place
 (d) center the colum headings and each column of text within the field
 (while retaining the right justification)
