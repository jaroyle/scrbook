Chapter 11 (Modeling Spatial Variation in Density) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Robin Russel (USGS National Wildlife Health Center)
(2) Leslie New (USGS PWRC).

Both Russel and New read the version submitted to the publisher.  
Russel's comments are listed in the document
"Chapters11docx_Robin_Russell_review.docx". 

Her comments were helpful and minor and we addressed them upon
preparing the edited page proofs. 

Dr. New made noted that we failed to define a few terms, and that the
figures needed minor improvements. We incorporated these changes.  

None of the reviewers raised any major concerns.
