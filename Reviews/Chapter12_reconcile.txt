Chapter 12 was reviewed by:

 (1) Robin Russell, USGS
 (2) Chris Sutherland, Cornell University
 
Their  comments  are  provided.  Both  reviewers  made a number  of
editorial comments to the chapter. Sutherland marked his comments
directly on the PDF document. 
Robin Russell provided some general comments and questions about 
potential ways the narrative could be embellished and we mostly
chose not to do those things because either they were covered in
previous chapters or because they seem to us to be extraneous or
unncessary.
She had a number of editorial suggestions which we accepted.
