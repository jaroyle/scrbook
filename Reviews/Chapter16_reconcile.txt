Chapter 16 (Open Population Models) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Krishna Pacifici - North Carolina State University
(2) Earvin Balderama - North Carolina State University


Pacifici's comments are in a document called: "Chapter16_pacifici.pdf".  He made
a number of comments both on content general editing.  His suggestions were very
helpeful and we corrected the text to address most of them directly.  We responded
to each comment from Dr. Pacifici within the pdf file as well.  Our response is
listed below his comment and starts with "Beth: ...."

Balderama's comments are provided in the document "Chapter16_review_Balderama.docx".  His comments
were mostly gramatical, but all very helpful.  We made all the suggested changes (except
where the text has been rewritten and the comment no longer applies).

The reviewers did not raise any major concerns.
