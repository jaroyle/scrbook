Chapter 19 (Spatial mark-Resight Models) was reviewed by two reviewers:
1) Brett McClintock, NOAA
2) Yifang Li, North Carolina State University
Both reviewers read the submitted version of the chapter.
Reviewer 1 had a few more substatial comments (annotated pdf 'Ch19_compressed_btm.pdf'):
- He suggested the inclusion of further references, which we addressed as suggested.
- He pointed out that our model development only applies to certain kinds of resighting methods and we now state that more explicitly.
- He pointed out a flawed example, which we swapped for a more realistic one.
- He suggested we re-focus the discussion of random sample assumtion in non-spatial mark-resight models, which we did 
In addition, he made several helpful suggestion providing additional background information on aspects of mark-resight, and had some minor comments
that helped improve the readability of the manuscript.

Reviewer 2 provided us with minor comments regarding grammar, notation and punctuation (document 'Ch19_Yifang_Li.pdf'), which we addressed as necessary (some were addressed  
automatically while creating the proofs; some we chose not to accept).
