Chapter 1:

You mention the uniformity of the state space (line 847-848) this is something a lot of ecologists-wildlife biologists get stuck on and don't like about SCR.  Is a discussion of this included in another Chapter?  Perhaps another line here just addressing whether this is something worth staying up at night worrying about or not and why or why not?

Seems like there is excess space after Fig. and Chapt in a number of places-Perhaps this was intentional?

Editorial comments

Caption Fig 1.2 "European wildcat loving on a scent stick"-might change that to "rubbing on a scent stick"

Line 522-524: I assume this sentence means that "when individual
s can be identified by vocalizations, you can use this information in the SCR framework", but it seems confusing as written.  Perhaps change "by" to "to".

Line 553  "etcdots"- I think this is a typo
Line 732: "the mean over individuals of the maximum distance moved"- I think this is confusing as written.
Perhaps "the mean of the maximum distance moved per individual"
Line 776-778: "and really it  hasn't"  -  use of "it" is vague, the word "really" seems unnecessary- I would change this to "which have failed to"
Line 847-848: "distributed" appears twice in this sentence.  Also the uniformity part is something that I find ecologists get really stuck on.  Perhaps you address this issue later in the chapter. Or could add a sentence here about the implications-or lack there of this assumption.

Section 1.5.3 This is a good-helpful description of the activity center.

Line 901:  "they" provide instead of "the" provide"?

Places where it looks like there is extra space:
Line 534: before 1.3
Line 564: in front of "Wegen"
Line 568: before 1.2
Line 577: before the 4 in Chapt 4
Line 638 before the 4
