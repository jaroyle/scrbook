Chapter 1 was reviewed by Leslie New, Robin Russell and Allan
O'Connell. Leslie and Allan provided mark-ups on the PDF. Robin
provided a bulleted list. Their 3 files are associated with the review
materials. 

All of their substantive editorial comments were addressed in the
revised copy-edited version (attached). 

Some of the subjective matters related to descriptive phrasing and
intent were not accepted.

Stylistic matters were not always accepted.


Substantive changes:

Leslie New suggested adding AIC to Table 1.1 which was done, along
with some relevant text to explain that.

Leslie New suggested switching Sections 1.3 and 1.4 which we have
done on the attached copy-edits.
