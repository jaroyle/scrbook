Chapter 2 (Statistical Inference and SCR) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Robin Russel (USGS National Wildlife Health Center)
(2) Leslie New (USGS PWRC).

Both Russel and New read the version submitted to the publisher.  
Russel's comments are listed in the document
"Chapters1-3_Robin_Russell_review.doc". 

All of her comments were helpful and minor and we addressed them upon
preparing the edited page proofs. 

New made many helpful suggestions for targeting the intended
audience. We incorporated these changes.  

None of the reviewers raised any major concerns.
