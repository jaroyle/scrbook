Chapter 3 (GLMs and Bayesian Analysis) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Robin Russel (USGS National Wildlife Health Center)
(2) Allan F. O'Connell (USGS PWRC).

Both Russel and O'Connell read the submitted version of this chapter. 
Russel's comments are listed in the document "Chapters1-3_Robin_Russell_review.doc"

All of her comments were helpful and minor and we addressed them upon preparing the edited page proofs.

O'Connell only communicated minor comments to us (located in the file 'Chapter3_aoc.pdf'), which we also addressed within the proof editing stage.

None of the reviewers raised any major concerns.
