Chapter 4 (Closed Population Models) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Marc Kery (Swiss Ornithological Institue)
(2) Allan F. O'Connell (USGS PWRC)


Kery read an early version of the chapter and all changes were made as per
his suggestions. They were quite helpful. The comments are given in the document. 
"Chapter4_Kery_Review[was Ch3].doc"

O'Connell read a more recent version of the chapter and only communicated very minor 
comments to us (located in the file 'Chapter4_aoc.pdf'), which we addressed within 
the proof editing stage.  He suggested moving a section, but gave no justification and 
we did not agree with this particular comment. We left the section where it was in the
chapter.


The reviewers did not raise any major concerns.
