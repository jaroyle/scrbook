Chapter 6 (MLE) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Bob Dorazio (USGS Florida Science Center)
(2) David Borchers (Univ. St. Andrews, Scotland).

Dorazio reviewed a slightly earlier version of the chapter 
(file name "Chapter6_reviewed_Dorazio.pdf") and provided the
report "Chapter6_Dorazio_Review[MLE].docx". 

All of his comments were helpful and addressed in the subsequent
revision.

The revised version ("Chapter6.pdf") was reviewed by David Borchers
who provided the report ("Chapter6_dlbComments.pdf") which is a mark-up
on the pdf document.

We took all of the suggested edits or moderated some of the stronger
statements about philosophy in the revision.  

There were no major issues brought up by either referee.
