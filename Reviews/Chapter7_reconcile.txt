Chapter 7 (Modeling Variation in Encounter Probability) was reviewed by two referees:

(1) Robin Russel (USGS National Wildlife Health Center)
(2) Allan F. O'Connell (USGS PWRC)

 
Russel's comments are listed in the document
"Chapters7_Robin_Russell.doc". All of her comments were helpful 
and minor and we addressed them upon preparing the edited page proofs. 

O'Connell read a more recent version of the chapter and only communicated very minor 
comments to us (located in the file 'Chapter7_aoc.pdf'), which we addressed within 
the proof editing stage. 


The reviewers did not raise any major concerns.
