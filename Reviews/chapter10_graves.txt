Overall, this chapter is a very nice overview of the design issues for SCR.  It also does a nice job summarizing the salient points of previous work.  

A few revisions would greatly improve the utility of the chapter however. 

1) Include more details on the parameters used in simulations.  Previous work has been done in situations with relatively high density and/or high N, which influences the results.   If cannot do this because of space, perhaps a statement referring to this issue would be good so people know to think about this and refer back to the original papers.
2) 
10.1.1 is not a very good example.  I couldn't think of a better one, but it would be nice if your example were something that you were estimating spatially.
3) More clearly making the point that these criteria are not really minimizing variance (density) which might be most interesting, and that there may be some way of doing that, but it hasn't been developed yet.  

I've attached minor suggestions to improve clarity here.
